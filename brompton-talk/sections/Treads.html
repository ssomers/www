future anguishing queries for all err... quacks?

<H2 ALIGN=center>What is a folding bicycle?  What is Brompton?</H2>

<H2><A NAME="3"></A>What is a folding bicycle?</H2>
<P>The folding world first of all classifies bicycles as:
<UL>
<LI><DFN>Cumbersomes</DFN>, standard one-piece bicycles without facilities for transporting them.
<LI><DFN>Separables</DFN> can be taken apart, mostly using tools.  You end up with a few smaller pieces.
<LI>The frame of <DFN>folders</DFN> hinges in one or more places.  Sometimes parts need to be taken out, but usually you end up with a single folded package.
<LI>The ultimate in folding is a <DFN>compact</DFN>, a bicycle folded to the size of a suitcase in less than a minute.
</UL>

<H2><A NAME="4"></A>Why is it wonderful?</H2>
<P>Because unlike "normal" bicycles, a folder can be:
<UL>
<LI>stored in a cupboard, or in a boat or caravan;
<LI>carried through doors, corridors and in lifts;
<LI>transported as luggage over long distances in plane, train, tram, bus or car;
<LI>left under your desk, barstool or shopping trolley, so
you needn't worry about it being stolen, vandalised or
tortured by weather
<LI>repaired on the kitchen table;
<LI>cleaned in the bathtub;
<LI>shared between all ages and genders, because most folders come in one size
with lots of room for adjustment.
</UL>
<P>
Not convinced yet?
With a folder, you can:
<UL>
<LI>enjoy bicycling more,
through commuting (travelling daily to your work) or touring
with part of the journey spent in plane, train, tram, bus or car;
<LI>stop commuting or touring when bad weather or a severe puncture occurs,
and continue or return in other vehicles;
<LI>park your car when you enter the city and cheerfully rush past
the traffic jam;
remember the air inside a car is three times more poluted than at
the cyclists mouth
<LI>get rid of your car and save lots of money, not to mention society and the planet.
</UL>

<H3><A NAME="5"></A>And why not?</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Because of the unisex, unishape, adjustable rendering of most brands of folders, the fit is never ideal.  On the other hand, some (Bike Fridays) are built to fit.
<LI>Weight and other factors of efficiency suffer under the constraints for foldability.
<LI>Parts and dealers are harder to find than for standard bicycles.
<LI>Obviously folders are more expensive than cumbersomes of similar quality.
</UL>

<H3><A NAME="6"></A>Pro's & con's of small wheeled bicycles</H3>
<P>Wheels cannot be folded, and you need two of them, so if you want a somewhat compact folder,
it has to sail on small wheels.
Admitted, the ordinary big bicycle wheel:
<UL>
<LI>has a slightly lower rolling resistance, given the same
tyre quality and appropriate pressure;
<LI>takes longer to be ground away by abrasive brake blocks;
<LI>and heats up less while braking;
<LI>has long spokes which absorb shocks better than short ones;
<LI>is easier to build around a big featuring an internal dynamo, brake or gears;
<LI>reaches high gears without requiring a gigantic front chainring;
<LI>has a far greater chance of negociating an unnoticed shallow kerbs;
<LI>gets you further off-road;
<LI>looks normal, whereas small wheels suggest the rider is a clown.
</UL>
<P>But, on the other hand:
<UL>
<LI>small wheels are lighter, which defeats not only gravity but also rotational latency;
i.e. they accelerate faster;
<LI>when wet, and not enjoying the virtues of a hub brake, the brake blocks/shoes have less water to clear before the braking gets though;
<LI>small wheels go out of true much less:
no need to interrupt touring because of some broken spokes
(and even if you carry spare spokes, they are easier to store);
<LI>they result in a low, genderless, easy to step over frame;
<LI>they are easier to work on, e.g. clean or fix a puncture.
<BR>
In particular, the Brompton makes wheel maintenance extremely easy because
it can be parked so that both wheels rotate freely and are accessible.
No need for special stands, hooks or the hassle of turning the bike upside down.
</UL>

<H3><A NAME="7"></A>Hub vs. derailleur gears</H3>

<H2><A NAME="8"></A>What is a Brompton?</H2>
<P>Brompton is an English brand of folders.  They have a few models that are variations on a patented frame.
It makes the most compact folded package on the market, yet a very roadworthy bicycle.
Therefore it is considered the best <EM>folding</EM> bicycle (as opposed to folding <EM>bicycle</EM>).

<H2 ALIGN=center>Is a Brompton really suitable for...?</H2>

<H2><A NAME="9"></A>Can you really ride more than 10 miles on that thing?</H2>
<UL>
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Andrew Brooks, Jul 1998:</EM><BR>
I've just bought a new &pound;800.00 mountain bike (Bontrager Privateer - LX/STX
groupset, V-brakes, front suspension etc) to do some off road riding.
It's interesting just how good the Brompton ride is in comparison (on the
road). The MTB wins on rigidity, weight and 'feeling of strength', but by
God the Brommy is quick off the mark and very manoeuvrable.
I had feared my pleasure in the Brompton would be compromised by my new
steed, but not at all. I'd still choose to ride it around town, just for
the ride.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Mike Hessey, May 2000:</EM><BR>
I did 60 miles in a day on a more or less standard Brompton T5 a few years
back and  didn't suffer any repercussions- I THINK I had a Brooks Swift
(Titanium) saddle at that time.
</UL>

<H2><A NAME="frail"></A>It's frail, isn't it?</H2>
After someone at Bike Friday headquarters was alleged to have suggested this...
<UL>
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Deborah Eacock, Oct 1999:</EM><BR>
Consider the source of this comment.  The disturbing comment that I have
heard is that Bike Friday, due to the lack of suspension acting on many
pivot points and quick releases, tend to get loose and sloppy with much
use.
<BR>
The Metro is BF's cheapest model and does not fold.
<BR>
The Brompton IS NOT frail. I have used my T5 constantly for more than three
years in all conditions.  It is still tight and reliable as when new.  I am
6'2", 165#, with the long seat-post.  My Moulton Mark 3 is rock-solid, but
it does not fold.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">De Clarke, Oct 1999:</EM><BR>
Hmm, I am on the heavy side and I don't feel as if my
Bromi is "frail" -- in fact it seems very sturdily
engineered, which accounts for its own not-insignificant
weight :-)
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Rob Cope, Oct 1999:</EM><BR>
No, as the Portly sub-genus of Brompton riders can confirm.
<BR>
I've broken various bits of a 1993 frame.  Covered by guarantee & the
newer frame parts are tougher (though usually lighter) than originals.
When Brompton refer to 'constant development' on the leaflets, it's
meant for real.
<BR>
Anyone worried that I  have broken frame bits should appreciate that I
dish out serious abuse levels: trailer hauling, down chalk pits, rough
paths...  If the factory ever shivers at what some of us do to their
little bikes, it doesn't show.   Presumably the strengthening process is
accelerated by us plump types straining things.
<BR>
Nothing's unbreakable, including Fridays.  These had a briefly poor
reputation in UK some years ago, as one small batch came in with weak
stems.  Long resolved, I hasten to add, & the various Fridays are
excellent bikes: just don't fold as small & neat as a Brom.
<BR>
Also, I don't see Dave Holladay switching to Fridays.  Nuff said.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">sdf, Oct 1999:</EM><BR>
I have owned both a Bike Friday New World Tourist and a Brompton L5. I
recognise that one can get into a semantic argument about the meaning of the
word 'frail'; however, one of the things I really disliked about the Bike
Friday was that it felt loose and rattled a lot whereas the Brompton feels
solid. I accept that the two bikes are made for different purposes but the
Brompton in regular use has a very solid feel.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Stephen Casey, Oct 1999:</EM><BR>
"Solid"?  Did you say "the Brompton feels solid"?  I won't get into a
"semantic argument" over the word "frail", but please define "solid".  If
you want my opinion about the stock Brompton (I have an L5 for what it is
worth) it is a piece of . . . no, no let's not say that . . . let's just say
it is NOT "solid".  I should say that I am a frequent user of the Brompton,
however, and am ever-amazed at how little engineering improvements have been
made to make this bike a truly "solid" design.  Rarely a day goes by that I
am not fidgeting, tightening, or bending something to get it to run.  I say
just bring along a 10 lb (that's about 4.5 kg) tool set and you'll be fine.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Chris Newport, Oct 1999:</EM><BR>
I've had a Brompton L5 for 2.5 years and I've put over a thousand miles
on it riding canal towpaths and commuting in London.
<BR>
I now also have a Berndes [the German folder Bernds??].
<BR>
My take on the 'frailty' of the Brompton is that it flexes more than
some folders and I have the impression that rear subframe and 16" wheels
are quite highly stressed carrying my 200-odd pounds weight, almost all
the weight being on the rear wheel.  Certainly the Berndes feels rock
solid in comparison (in fact more than some cumbersomes I've owned).
<BR>
But the Brompton frame is designed to withstand that stress.  The
'frailty' is largely a perception based on appearance and the small
amount of movement that is designed in to absorb the stresses.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Ian Charles, Oct 1999:</EM><BR>
To me, the Brompton feels like a conventional bike (in the best sense). I
fail to understand how anyone can describe it as 'frail' - on the contrary,
I wonder sometimes whether it needs to be quite as 'solid' and if some
further weight gains could be made. OK, I'm nearer the 150 pound mark and
maybe heavier and taller folk don't find it as comfortable. But surely with
the various adjustments possible, the Brompton must suit all but the most
extreme persons in terms of height/weight?
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Stringer, Mark, Oct 1999:</EM><BR>
I was thinking about this last night as I rolled along the Hudson
River on a "under construction" bike path. Over gravel, dirt and pavement I
the bike felt good. It's no mountain bike, but seems to be able to handle
the often bumpy, pot-holed streets of Manhattan. Also, it can withstand the
forces incurred when climbing very steep hills. My Strida could never make
the climb from 125 st to 110 st on Broadway, it would've collapsed.
<BR>
So after 6 days of Manhattan rough rides, I'd say solid
<LI><EM CLASS="from">David Edge, Oct 1999:</EM><BR>
I don't recall Brompton ever having to do a product recall, and I rather
fancy that Friday once did.
[In 2002, Brompton sort of recalled the handlebars on older models]
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Custfold, Oct 1999:</EM><BR>
There are weak points in any bike design.  The original Brompton which John
Grimshaw bought for Sustrans split at the seat clamp but was re-welded and
used by the late David Groome for many years - and the 1988 series of
Bromptons moved the clamp to the back of the seatpost.
<BR>
I have had rear frames fail (6 or 7) - less since the design was changed to
remove stress raisers, and I also had bracing added at weak point.
<BR>
I have had main frames smile (fail) (3 - although all but one were 1988
design without the reinforced weld)
<BR>
I have had front main frames fail (4-6) and cured this with reinforced front
frame.
<BR>
I have had luggage blocks shear off the bolts (carrying 30 Kg or more though)
<BR>
The old seatposts bent and used to eventually snap of the tops - cured by my
pre production concept of an extending post.
<BR>
Oh and handlebars - cured by using steel ones.
<BR>
But be aware that I [<A CLASS="quick" HREF="Tricks.html#Custfold">Tips, tricks & tinkering - Dave Holladay</A>] used to break one conventional frame a year anyway.

</UL>
[Post scriptum from the maintainer of this site:
in 2001, my Brompton's frame turned out to be overstressed.
I was blamed for causing the problem, but no clear causes were identified.
After more than eight months and some arguments, it was replaced virtually for free.
The frame lived some 5 years and travelled less than 5000km.
I weighed "only" 85 kg.
I use that Brompton only a few times a year anymore.

<H3><A NAME="11"></A>Frame material</H3>
<UL>
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Custfold:</EM><BR>
The Brompton's mild steel construction is a real saving grace when, like me
you punish it.  Cromo frames I have ridden usually fracture about once a
year, instantly and catastrophically.  Mild steel has plenty of helpful grain
boundaries and crack stoppers, and MS frames have a pleasant habit of
deforming to extraordinary contortions before a gentle tearing of the
remaining section gives a catastrophic failure.  I am on my third main frame,
but with my record of destroying conventional bikes
[<A CLASS="quick" HREF="Tricks.html#Custfold">Tips, tricks & tinkering - Dave Holladay</A>]
the performance of the Brompton is exceptional.
Useful indicators are the way in which the paint
film lifts around a crack - any unexplained shedding of paint should be
checked thoroughly, and the frame will distort sufficiently to make riding
feel very odd - crab like - well before you are likely to get dumped
gracefully on the road.  Brompton have been very helpful in analysing any
problems, and this has usually resulted in design improvements where a
potential long term stress raiser for the less strenuous rider is
highlighted.  If you start bashing pedals on corners, check the main frame
for possible distortion.  If the rear hinge, or connections to it fail the
bike can still be 'ridden' with care by tying this hard on to the main bike.
</UL>

<H2><A NAME="12"></A>Can tall people ride a Brompton?</H2>
<EM CLASS="from">Andy Cohen:</EM><BR>
When I go shopping for a non-folding bicycle, I make sure to buy the
right size for my body. I'm just tall enough (6' 2") to make it hard to
find a used bicycle that fits me comfortably.
<BR>
I'm thinking about buying a folding bicycle, but each of them seems to
come in only one size. Are they somehow more adjustable than non-folding
bicycles, or do taller and smaller people just put up with the lack of
different bike sizes for the sake of the folding feature?
<UL>
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Steven D. Hanel:</EM><BR>
They are extremely more adaptable than a normal wedgie. Bromptons have a
larger seat post if the standard doesn't fit. The Bike Friday is built
for you to your preferences. The Dahon's are pretty broad range of fit
but I don't think they have additional fitting options.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Channell Wasson:</EM><BR>
Andy, The Brompton is a one size fits all machine.
Although the fit may not be perfect.
The adjustment takes place through the seat tube or pillar being
positioned comfortably for a reasonable reach to the pedals.
The taller you are the more you may have to lean forward to reach
the handle bars.
People from 5' to 6' 5" have purchased Bromptons and have found them
satisfactory after a break-in period.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Stein Somers:</EM><BR>
Last weekend, after 1 month on the Brompton and 600km under its wheels,
I tried my good "normal", size 63 light touring bike again.
I wasn't particularily impressed by the sitting comfort and found the
gigantic wheels quite silly.
<BR>
I also compared the sitting position, with aligned pedal axis:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>the Brompton saddle is 4cm more to the rear because the frame
tube is fixed behind the bottom bracket and not on it,
while the angle of the seat tube and pillar is identical;
<LI>the front wheel is 2cm less to the front;<BR>
<LI>the rear wheel is 5cm less to the rear.
</UL>
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Leonard Rubin:</EM><BR>
The easiest, cheapest solution is to add a quick release to the
handlebar/stem interface. It is absolutely essential that only one that is
well-matched to the job in terms of strength, quality and geometry be used,
as this is a rather critical bolt! I sell a proprietary one that is
particularly well-suited to the job, but if you tend to be mechanically
careless or absent-minded (you probably know if that's a fair description
of you), then it's a bad idea altogether. If you are tuned in to
adjustments, it's a fantastic addition, as it lets you achieve the much
more efficient (and in my own, American opinion, much more comfortable for
all but the shortest, flattest rides) standard, slightly stretched position,
compared to the nearly bolt-upright one dictated by the bar position
required for folding. The penalty is one additional step in the folding
procedure (return bars to upright position), but that's a small price to
pay!
<BR>
I leave the brake levers just a tad loose, so that I can swivel them into
the ideal position, as well, but this is a very dicey area in which to be
tossing about recommendations, so I never said it!
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Rob Cope, Jul 1998:</EM><BR>
I am 6'2 as well and use a Brompton every day.  Yes, it would be nice to
have a slightly longer reach (to match my Moulton Deluxe) and the very
upright position is about as aerodynamic as a brick.  But I do not find it
uncomfortable, even for longer distances (though I think 'horses for
courses' applies in spadeloads).  You will need the extended seatpost,
possibly the adjustable telescopic version plus a decent saddle.  And it is
an acquired taste: first time I tried a Brompton, I could not deal with the
light handling and apparent back-heaviness.  Now I revel in the nippy
manoeuvrability.  Borrow or hire one for the weekend, preferably with the
clip-on front bag, then decide if the plusses for the minuses win out.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Stein Somers, Jul 1998:</EM><BR>
I'm 6'5"/ 1m96, spend almost an hour a day on the telescopic seat post, and
would also like higher handlebars.  I've mounted L-shape bar ends so as
to higher the steering bar a luxurious 15 cm.  However the brakes and

The soon to be produced recumbent kit features a higher stem, but it is
meant for that laid back position where the legs and not the arms hold
one's body back.  It has been suggested here that Brompton warranty
fades when you change anything to the stem or handlebars; indeed the
stem bolt has some a "marking paint" on it.  I wonder if there is an
agreement about this issue between Juliana Neuss and Brompton?
<BR>
By the way the Birdy's special telescopic stem reaches only an inch
higher than the Brompton's ordinary stem, on the other hand the straight
bar doesn't get in the way of one's knees.

I had the good fortune to buy my T5 from a 6 foot 4 in or so guy who
found the handlebar to saddle distance too short for his sense of security.
He bought the machine but didn't persevere with it so I got a new-condition machine
and accessories at a big discount.
I would guess that it is leg length that is the problem, and people of course vary a lot
in this measurement.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Willi Mindak, Oct 98:</EM><BR>
I'm about the same height (1.86m), and I weight quite a bit more.
If the Brompton is equipped with the telescopic seat post, and the saddle is moved back a bit
I find the seating position tolerable, even on longer runs (I do the occasional 25 mile run).
It is a bit too upright, though, and consequently the air resistance is quite noticeable.
I find that out of the saddle work is too cramped to be maintained for any length of time.
<BR>
I actually prefer the more upright stance the Brompton forces me into, because I'm beyond
the first flush of youth, and who wants to do his back in?
The crank- arm length is o.k. for taller riders, but beware of kerbs and corners.
When pedalling through even a mild curve the inside pedal hits the ground with sometimes comic,
sometimes more serious consequences (I have the scars to prove it).
For that reason I would not recommend longer cranks.

My son David, now nearly 9, took to my Bromp T5 at the end of the last

ridden it ever since. He has gradually raised the seat pillar as he has
grown (he's now 4 feet 10 inches!) and also has the handlebars angled
towards him. As a parent it would have cost a fortune to equip him with a
new pseudo mountain bike every year, so the money on the L5 was well spent.

The (average sized) 10 y.o. has to have the seat post very low, to the
point where the bottom of the post is near the ground and the bike
cannot do first fold.

This and the (not ideal even for me) near vertical position of the brake

[The back wheel assembly swinging underneath as easily as deploying a kick

<UL>
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Anthony Cartmell, Sep 1997:</EM><BR>
When unfolded the rear wheel assembly presses against a rubber block,
which compresses when you sit on the bike.  This provides suspension to
make the ride more comfortable.
<BR>
Unless you plan on cycling off cliffs the rear suspension won't fold
while you are riding the bike.  On bumpy terrain the rubber suspension
block absorbs the bumps quite well, but stays very compressed by your
weight on it.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Peter Amey, Sep 1997:</EM><BR>
the same pivoting section is what provides the rear
suspension.  There is absolutely no problem with this arrangement in
practice and, if it really troubled someone, a simple strap round the
seat post can be used to hold the rear section in place.  I have never
felt the need to do this.

I have ridden off of curbs many times, sometimes even with loads on the

I like riding out of the pedal [sic] sometimes - if only to gain more power
climbing a hill or against the wind (some time ago a previous contributor
made an interesting suggestion that Europeans tend to push harder in higher
gears even if it means pedalling more slowly while Americans go for cadence
and easier gears); in any event, doing this with the Brompton definitely

this is because there is less incentive to push so hard when the

I would like to wait for my other MTB, which uses the same type of computer.
I was "fresh" on the B, and I was a bit 'peeked' on the MTB, having just done
a 9 mile "sprint".  But, the impute controls should have negated "lack of

Some rather less formal results: Arnold (my T5, 12% reduced gears)
recently made me join the local touring bike club. They have various
categories of rides, so I started with C (for average cyclists). Did
a couple of nice pleasant rides (25 miles or thereabouts) and Arnold
had no trouble at all keeping up. Given an upslope (nothing very long
or very steep) I had to hold him back or (a couple of times) let him
zoom uphill and then wait at the top.
<BR>
On Sunday (July 4th, US holiday, parades and such) the club organized
a parade ride. Decorate your bike, wear red, white, and blue, and join
this mass of bikes rolling through various towns in advance of or behind
their parade. 25 miles with categories from A (the sort of people who
do 100 miles in 5 hours) down to C* ("solid cyclists"). Again, a fairly
easy route and not going at A pace, but Arnold was up with the lead group
for 18 miles before the front tire went flat :-( Maybe he was fed up
with having to carry a couple of small US flags sticking out of the
springs of his Brooks saddle. (Come on Arnold, forgive me please for
this lack of patriotic support).
<BR>
Yesterday (holiday observed) he went on another C ride. Well, there were
only 7 turned up and someone was late and part of the group waited and
three of us set off. We went substantially faster than C pace. Arnold
and his 5 gears was only in trouble on upslopes where the speed fell
just below 15 mph, and I had to drop a gear. The gap between 4th and
3rd is too wide--I can't pedal fast enough uphill to maintain 14mph
in 3rd, so we would slowly fall behind and have to pedal a bit harder
to catch up downhill or on the flat.
<BR>
All very unscientific in measuring the capabilities of a Brompton,
and my legs are presumably in better condition than I expected, but
it does show that a perfectly ordinary Brompton is a fine vehicle.
I can't compare it to other bikes. I don't have any.

Birdy has V-brakes which will effectively stop you

This could save your life if, for example, a car suddenly pulled out of a driveway

I have only ever carried luggage on my Brompton with the front
pannier bag (<A CLASS="quick" HREF="Tricks.html#cloth_pannier">Tips, tricks & tinkering - The Brompton cloth front pannier</A>).  Even when this is stuffed full with heavy shopping,
it doesn't have a big effect on the handling.  Carrying luggage
on the rear of a Brompton might not affect the handling much either
as it is pretty low down.  It will however totally mess up the folding
of the bike until you remove it !
<BR>
If you want a bike that you can ride for long distances whilst
touring, then a proper touring bike might be better.  I don't
find my Brompton uncomfortable, but over long distances,
being 30% slower can make the difference between getting home

I was in Mexico last week and rode 52 miles from airport
in Baja to my house.  The Brompton was the greatest for this road trip I
used touring bar ends and had my suitcase on the rack.  I had expanded
the rack size with a light weight bbq grill bought at local hardware

I have never toured on a Brompton, there is no need as I also
have a Moulton AM7 for that purpose,  but a recent 13 mile fairly hilly
ride on my 5-speed nine years old T5 left me with a noticeable sense of
tired legs which the same ride on a big bike or the Moulton doesn't
cause.  I have a front mounted thermoplastic briefcase, which has big
frontal area, but at low speeds unless there is a headwind this is not a
problem.  The lack of any front shock absorber when running on hard
(75psi) Raleigh Record tyres is in my experience the greatest single
factor in making the Brompton an unrealistic choice for loaded touring
on anything but flat and smooth terrain.  But I am over 50 and not as
resilient as once was.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Norman Tulloch:</EM><BR>
It is a brilliant design, folds quickly into a compact package (though not
a very light one) and the front pannier is excellent.

However, it is not particularly pleasant on roughish roads.  I live in a
country area where the roads, though good, are not always billiard-table
smooth.  The Brompton is fine on smooth surfaces: one can whir along quite
happily and pleasantly, but as soon as one hits a less good surface, things
change: the bike judders and stutters and rattles and generally becomes not
much fun.  My large-wheeled traditional touring bike flows over the same
surfaces in a relaxed, smooth, quiet and soothing way.  (One thing that
does annoy me about the Brompton is its various rattles.  Bikes should be
QUIET.)

I don't know if you need to improve it. I mounted a pair of Biogrips to

carried all the luggage. In one case I did a weekend trip with the tent
and sleeping bag and maitress on the rear rack and some cloths in the
front bag (and the Alto =3D "Bratsche" in the backpack. I did 80 km on

We came back last week from a tour in north England (York, Scarborough).
Our 'improvements' consisted of a T5 with the same front bag, a nylon

for photo gear. In total, we had ca. 16kg of luggage per person. This
was an adequate solution for us, though we had to walk up the steeper
hills. I don't know whether the first gears of a T3 and a T5 are much
different, but if you insist on cycling uphill, you should consider a
seriously smaller gear.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Rob Cope, Aug 1998:</EM><BR>
I find the biggest problem with a Brompton medium/ long distance is the
difficulty varying cycling position.  I can walk up steep hills, get more
than enough luggage on the front block or in a Bike-Hod - but sore back,
numb hands &amp; bum is no fun.  So I suggest;
<BR>
Find your favourite saddle &amp; fit it; even if it is heavy and expensive.
I've currently got a Vetta(?) with 2 gel layers & twin springs, but still
suspect I'll end up with a wide Brooks.  The Brompton throws all your weight
on the saddle, so it has to be good?
<BR>
I have ended up with the Biogrips on by bars: horrible price (16-23GBP:
cheaper in Germany) but near-indestructible and *no more numb hands*.
Cyclecare keep em & IIRC Giant are also importing them.  I'd like to fit the
neat mini bar-ends Avon Valley Cycles do, but have yet to work out they
could coexist with the Biogrips.
<BR>
Brakes: I am lucky enough to have the original Sachs fitted which work OK
once long Koolstop pads were substituted.  The Alhonga dual pivots look
(from friends machines) to work well on the front but IMHO the backbolt &
washers is not sufficient to take the greater braking force.
<BR>
Luggage: the Brompton positively thrives on front loads.  Do a Henshaw: buy
a big cheap waterproof holdall then fit a mounting bracket (Custom Folder
sell one) for the front block.  Details in the new A to B just out.  Make
sure the bag does not stick far beyond the front axle, else the whole thing
may pivot round that axle & spontaneously fold (not when you're aboard, I
hasten to add).
<BR>
Gears: yes, get the lower gears but I find a gentle push up steep hills much
more pleasant than straining at the same speed awheel.  You see so much more
and the bike is still taking the load.

required riding 100 miles each day. I am happy to report the Brompton
served me well and we rolled to the finish line late Sunday afternoon.

Over the two days we averaged 12.8 mph. The course was somewhat hilly on
the second day but there was the benefit of a tailwind the last thirty
miles. Several roadies misidentified the bike as a Bike Friday. There
were in fact, at least three Friday=92s on the ride, but as best I could
determine a sole Brompton.  A fellow rider on seeing the Bee folded on

I just want to share my experience riding my L5 this past weekend as I was
pleasantly surprised at how well the bike performed.  On Saturday I
participated on an organized groupd ride which covered the perimeter of
NYC's Manhattan island.  Before the ride, we were forewarned about riding on
dirt roads, gravel, hopping onto sidewalks, etc.  Hopefully someday, the
city will completely develop a full scale, well groomed bike/pedestrian path
around the island as it contains so much potential for leisure use.
<BR>
Anyway, the ride turned out to be a mini cyclcross expedition as the route
was very disjointed.  At many instances we would have to get off the bicycle
and carry it over a guardrail, up a steep set of steps a sand/salt dune or
some other obstacle.  The people I rode with had mountian bikes or very
robust hybrid bikes.  It definitely was an advantage for me carrying the
Brompton instead of one of the full sized bicycles.   Definitely not very
technical, but modestly challenging and varried was the terrain we rode on
from NYC smooth to pot hole laden pavement, loose fine gravel, dirt paths,
paths covered with foliage to cobble stone roads.  I did not bother hopping
any curbs as it was really not necessary nor would I want to do so with the
B. (It's sharp handling and with ease manueverability makes it a trivial
exercise when riding along deserted sidewalks to eventaully find the
sidewalk ramp) That said, the bike handled remarkably well.  I felt very
secure while riding the B over such terrain.  In particular, I was impressed
at how much the rear suspension block dampened alot of road shock while
riding over a stretch of cobble stone road.
<BR>
During the ride, I had witnessed some great river side sights and had
attracted alot of attention (and possibly envy? from my fellow riders).
While the group had stopped at one point to study a BMW being lifted out of
the Hudson river - a Police department diver had came running over to ask me
about the B.  It also was a nice spectacle to fold up the bike and take it
into the donut shop for our groups rest stop while the other bikes remained
unsecurely parked outside.

<H2><A NAME="22"></A>Can you store a Brompton on a boat and not have it rust away?</H2>
<UL>
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Jerry Kaidor, May 1999:</EM><BR>
The Brompton's frame is mild steel, first galvanized (covered with zinc)
and then powder-coated over the galvanizing. That's
about as rust-resistant as a steel finish gets.  As long as you don't
scratch the paint, the frame itself should be fine.  Of course, there's
also the accessories, brakes, shifters, spokes, etc which would rust at
whatever rate is normal for those.
As far as rust is concerned:  The frame is mild steel.  This is
galvanized, and then powder-coated over the galvanizing.  That's about
as good as you get with steel.  I don't know about the fittings, bolts etc
though.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Nico J. de Boer, May 1999:</EM><BR>
And don't be too optimistic about that rate in corrosive environments:
my "dynamo rear rack stay" is very flecky indeed, the pump rusts inside,
the wheel axis bolts tend to get corroded as well, and inside the chain
guide wheel axes some rust may develop. The "folding axis" of the folding
pedal doesn't look too shiny, the spokes tend to rust a little, and the
saddle clamp bolt is a bit orange too. You can say I should polish those
parts more often...
Could it be that all this corrosion arises from the contact of different
metals?

<UL>
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Tom Bennett, Aug 1999:</EM><BR>
Drawbacks of the Brompton:  First, the weight.  Although it doesn't seem
heavy at first, try carrying the Brompton any distance, and you will realize
that it is not a task done for amusement.  The little wheels are pathetic for
rolling any more than a few feet at a time.  Interestingly enough, the wheels
never smashed into my ankle bones after the first day or two of riding.  I
guess there's nothing like excruciating, agonizing pain to divert you from a
bad habit.   The brakes are pretty pathetic, but I got used to them, more or
less.  They slow you down, anyway.  The one hassle is that you can't really
feel totally free zooming down hills, because you know that you'll need about
a mile to stop.  I rationalize this by realizing that it is good training in
case I ever decide to become a locomotive engineer.

As one might expect, most contributers on Brompton-Talk are using their Brompton,
so they consider it at the very least useful. Really disappointed customers won't
spend more time and money complaining on a mailing list that the manufacturer
isn't even reading. Still here's a summary of problems that came up, in my personal
order of importance:
<UL>
<LI>Broken handlebars:
as on many bicycles, the handlebars are made of Aluminium to
reduce weight.
On oversized mountainbikes, Aluminium may last forever,
but on the Brompton the 2mm thick tubing isn't up to rough daily use.
For the gory details, read <A CLASS="quick" HREF="Tricks.html#BrokenHandlebar">Tips, tricks & tinkering - Broken handlebars</A>.
<LI>Handlebar tuning:
The peculiar Brompton steering column doesn't allow any adjustment.
the handlebars fixed into this column can easily be exchanged for ordinary
bicycle handlebars, but these would end up particularly low,
unsuitable for the tall or anyone enjoying an upright riding position.
On the other hand, some people find the standard handlebars to high.  More in <A CLASS="quick" HREF="Tricks.html#alt_handlebars">Tips, tricks & tinkering - Alternative handlebars</A>.
<LI>Brakes:
some are disappointed by the standard brakes fitted until March 2000,
particularly when it's wet (see <A CLASS="quick" HREF="Tricks.html#BrakeOpinions">Tips, tricks & tinkering - Stock brake effectiveness</A>).
More importantly, some ruin their rear rim after less than a year of daily use.
Like the handlebars, this is a common problem in bicycles these days:
hard brake blocks pick up grit and grind the soft aluminium (again!) rims away.
For some year, the Brompton - as other bicycles - came with anodized rims (aluminium
with a hard coating).  But as soon as the brake blocks pick up parts of the anodizing,
they grind the rest of the rim away faster than if the "protection" hadn't been there.
On a Brompton the rims are only half as long as on big wheels, so the
problem shows up earlier.
<BR>
However both problems can be resolved either by:
<UL>
<LI>(very) regular cleaning of the brake blocks, as the manual faintly points prescribes
<LI>replacing the brake blocks with high quality, softer material (see <A CLASS="quick" HREF="Tricks.html#AltBrakeBlocks">Tips, tricks & tinkering - Alternative brake blocks</A>)

<H2><A NAME="24"></A>Brompton service</H2>
I live in Belgium, close to the UK but for the bit of water in between.
My Brompton has been in service three times.
The first time it took four months to repair a broken rim
(cause and lessons learnt: see <A CLASS="quick" HREF="Tricks.html#cracked_rim">Tips, tricks & tinkering - Rims worn out</A>).
According to the bike shop, most of the delay was due to Brompton shipping the part.
The second time it took three months to replace a broken frame (some time after it crashed into a car).  Same excuse.
The third time it took nine months to replace a frame (alledgedly due to improper use by me).
<BR>
On the other hand, service inside the UK is reported to be quite good:
<UL>
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Peter Amey, Jul 1998:</EM><BR>
Quick update on the broken front frame tube I reported a couple of weeks
back.
<BR>
Brompton have replaced the frame component under warranty including
covering all transport costs to return the machine.  Turn round time was 1
week.  While they had it they have changed a few other things, such as a
worn saddle, and replaced/serviced the rear pivot bearings.  I was told
this was "compensation for the inconvenience" of being without the
machine for a week (I had forgotten just how cumbersome cumbersomes are!).
Overall quite impressive service.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">David Cox, Jun 2000:</EM><BR>
Replacing the rear mudguard (fender) on my Brompton L3 has become something
of a marathon.  After six years hard use the guard cracked after a
transatlantic flight, nearly a year later and after another trip it split
and was held together for 3 months with duct tape but it finally gave up on
the Waendel ride in Wellingborough.
<BR>
I'd ordered a new mudguard via my local dealer but it arrived 3 weeks later
as a basic guard with no stays, I then ordered the stays which arrived after
another 2 weeks. However, I couldn't fit it last night because all of the
fittings are either ground down by constant folding or rusted in.  I now
need to order every specific bolt and plate it appears. When I buy Esge/SKS
guards for my other bikes (infrequently they also last years) they come with
the fittings and go straight on !
<BR>
No doubt Brompton are trying to save us money but six year old fittings cant
be recycled; so if you need to replace your mudguard make sure that you
order every last nut, plate, bolt and screw or like me you'll have half a
C-type and a wet bum.  Not ideal for commuting in June in UK.

<H2><A NAME="AndrasToth"></A>Case Study by Andras Toth, March 1998</H2>
I have had my Brompton for more than 4 months now and have been subscribed
to the mailing list since January. I find it is a good forum for discussing
Brompton-related technical issues, but I personally lack the user aspect of
it.  I think it is best to admit right at the start that even changing the
tyre on the back wheel of my bicycle is a considerable challenge to me, and
I presume it must be the case for the silent majority of urban cyclists.
However, this does not prevent me from doing everyday cycling and being
committed to the propagation of alternative means of transport.
It is my belief that Brompton is truly a revolution in the concept of the
bicycle. In comparison to its importance, the ways in which it could modify
our society's travelling behaviours does not get enough attention on this
forum.
That is why I have decided to make public a detailed description of my
usage of Brompton. This case study was originally compiled for a friend
interested in new means of personal transportation who did not know
Brompton. It certainly repeats a lot of information that you already know.
What I would like to do is to incite reactions on the way I am using my
Brompton, especially in the second part of my study.
I will publish it in two parts in order to reduce the amount of eventual
responses flowing in at the same time.
Here is the complete table of contents of my study.

0. Introduction
</H4>
The following analysis will be based on the everyday use of a Brompton L3
bicycle (complete foldability, 3 gears, no initial light or carrier system)
in Paris. That is, it takes into account the current position of foldable
bicycles in society and on the market (their available features, their
uniqueness, their price etc) . By no means is this an analysis of the
potential role that these types of bicycles could play if they are ever
manufactured in massive quantities and become wide-spread in a community.
<H4>
1. How I bought it
</H4>
I saw the first Brompton in my life at the Annual General Meeting of the
European Cyclists' Federation in Vienna in 1994. This remained the only
context where I kept meeting them in the following years, until I bought my
own. I have never seen one in the street or heard or seen any kind of
advertisement for it (in Brussels, Budapest, Paris).  It seems the Brompton
firm for some reason does not intend to break through with their models on
the international market, they are satisfied with keeping the Brompton in
the class of expensive elite bicycles accessible only to a relatively
wealthy public.
There were three factors that made me buy a Brompton on 9th November 1997:
previous direct experience with it, a concrete problem that only a foldable
bike could solve, and the favorable conditions of its purchase.
<H5>
1.1. Previous direct experience
</H5>
In 1995 I had the occasion to try a five speed model in Brussels, in a
hilly urban context for a few hours. Without the extremely satisfactory
results of this probe I would have never seriously considered buying one.
It may be one of the drawbacks with expensive bicycles that people do not
usually get to ride them on longer distances before they make the decision
of buying them or not. The ultimate convincing power is real-life experience.
<H5>
1.2. A concrete need
</H5>
Even with this, the Brompton would have remained one of my numerous dreams
in life if I had not moved to Paris in October 1997 on a nine-month
scholarship. What pushed me into considering the purchase of a Brompton was
a concrete objective need. I had sworn to myself that I would use a bicycle
in Paris just as I do in Budapest and as I did in Brussels on another
scholarship. However, it turned out that my accommodation was near one the
southern gates of inner Paris and my university 5 kilometers north from the
northern edge of the town, in Saint-Denis. On a normal bike I would have
had to cover 30 kilometers every day, crossing the very center of Paris and
going on highways in a sea of cars. The only way to achieve daily commuting
by bicycle and also to shorten the one hour trip to 35-40 minutes was to
take the bicycle in the suburban underground train (RER) that crossed the
center of Paris. The only bicycle with which I could do this was the Brompton.
<H5>
1.3. A favorable deal
</H5>
A third factor, the proximity of Great Britain also played an important
role. In France, the model I bought costs 4700 franks (approx. 780 USD). In
Britain, 391 GBP (approx. 610 USD). A difference of about 1000 French
franks! Fortunately, a friend living in London just happened to jump over
to Paris and he was kind enough to buy the bike for me there and bring it
with him. The knowledge that prices are so much lower in Britain might
convince people that it is not worth buying a Brompton from the resellers
in their country. On the other hand, getting a Brompton from Britain is not
always as convenient as in my case.
<BR>
What should be remembered from all this is that an average person is not
likely to have any of my motivating factors to buy a foldable bicycle.
<H4>
2. The features of the Brompton
</H4>
<H5>
2.1. Unfolded mode
</H5>
There is little danger of being wrong if I say that unfolded, the Brompton
works as any other city bicycle. The joints are solid and with the
three-gear system I can move around as easily and quickly (even on slopes)
as on a traditional bicycle. The lack of an original lighting system is
rapidly compensated with removable back and front lights that I take off
when I fold the bicycle. The main difference is in stability, due to the
small diameter of the wheels, but I am not sure whether it is a drawback or
an advantage. Although at first it was weird that the bicycle responded to
the slightest move of my hands on the handlebars, I never feel unsecure,
even when I am descending from a hill at full speed. On the other hand, the
size of the wheels makes it much easier to navigate between cars trapped in
a traffic jam or other obstacles that require intensive steering.
What is clearly a disadvantage is the extreme sensibility of the bicycle to
the unevenness of the road surface. It is virtually impossible to ride on a
paved road, and even relatively smooth surfaces that you do not even notice
on a normal bike are unpleasant for a Brompton user. However, occasional
bumps are not a problem (even fun to take), because the bicycle has
excellent suspension thanks to the rubber bumper at the meeting point of
the rear wheel assembly and the rest of the bicycle.
The other thing that I find uncomfortable is the way the rear wheel
assembly flaps back when I lift the bicycle by the handlebar and the seat
pillar. The manual says I should not bother about it, just let it hang and
bump into everything, but I do find it a nuisance when I have to lift the
unfolded bicycle on stairs. So what I do is that I grab the back by the
rear wheel assembly instead of the seat pillar, which requires a little
more bending and effort from me, but keeps the bicycle together.
The positive aspect of this feature is that parking the Brompton by
swinging the rear wheel assembly under the bicycle is even easier than
parking a normal bike.
I have not been to a longer trip with the Brompton yet, but I have the
feeling I could easily do 50 kilometers on it at one go. One Sunday
afternoon and evening I did about 30 kilometers, with several
interruptions, but in very hilly areas of Paris. I felt tired sometimes
during but not after the trip. In the last section, on my way home at 11.30
pm I even raced a little on the empty avenues, attaining a speed of 40-50
km/h.
<H5>
2.2. Folding/Unfolding
</H5>
The average time for these actions is 17-18 seconds in my practice, not
counting the mounting and dismounting of the front light in the dark (the
back light is constantly on the seat pillar just under the seat).
<H5>
2.3. Folded mode
</H5>
The Brompton is closest of all existing bicycles to the concept of
portability, but it is not a portable bicycle. A little smaller and 5
kilogramms lighter, it would be one. But at 11 kilogramms and at the size
of a small suitcase, it is only suited to be carried on small distances and
in uncrowded public spaces. At 5 pm, I do not even attempt to take the
subway with it, I know I would not be able to get on the train with
something so big in my hands. In folded mode the bicycle can be pulled by
the unfolded handlebar on its miniature plastic wheels. I rarely use this
function, because it is useful only in very specific conditions: when the
distance is too long to carry the bicycle in your hands but too short to
unfold it, and you know that you would have to unfold and fold it several
times. Also it is quite uncomfortable for someone of my height (178
centimeters) to drag it this way, I have to lift the front a bit and thus
the bicycle easily looses its equilibrium. Not to mention that these mini
wheels are even more sensitive to the unevenness of the ground, you can
only use them on completely smooth surfaces.
So most of the time I just grab the folded bicycle by its saddle and carry
it as a suitcase. I switch hands every hundred meters approximately so that
I avoid feeling tired in my arms too quickly.
Unless the frame of the bicycle is dirty too, you will not get stained
carrying the Brompton. What the brochure says is true: the chain is inside
the folded frame and does not get in contact with you or other people
standing beside you.
The only extra piece that I would readily buy for my bicycle is the folding
left pedal. In folded mode, this is the only part of the bicycle that
sticks out from the otherwise compact assembly, and it bumps into
everything when I carry it.
<P>
In reply to some negative comments received concerning the publication of
my study on this list, just two remarks:
<UL>
<LI>Obviously my intention is not to convince you about the utility of the
Brompton. I just wanted to compare my experience with others'. I thought
that everybody out there would be able to disregard the original intention
of the study, but apparently it is too difficult for some.
<LI>There is a nice button in most mailreaders called 'Trash' or 'Delete'. If
you do not want to read the rest, it is up to you to press it. When I do
it, I generally do not announce it to all the members of the list. If the
message is too big and causes disturbance like in the case of the picture
posted a few weeks ago, of course we have to discuss it, but I believe my
study does not occupy enough space on your mail servers to cause major
inconvenience.
</UL>
<BR>
Having stated that, here is the second part of the study (chapter 3-5),
dealing more specifically with my strategy to use the Brompton in Paris.
I would really like to hear your comments about how *you* handle the
situations described below. Consider my text as a series of questions
rather than statements.
<H4>
3. Using the Brompton
</H4>
<H5>
3.1. Cycling strategy
</H5>
The main advantage of the ideal portable bicycle is that you can switch
from cycling to another mode of transport at any point in your trip.
Possible reasons include big traffic, bad weather, exhaustion or illness,
distance, flat tyre. However, as every urban cyclist knows it, if the
distance is inferior to five kilometers the most convenient means of
transport remains the bicycle. So in approximately 50% of all my trips in
Paris I use exclusively the bicycle in its unfolded mode (the city center
is about 5 kilometers from my place). If I have the time or feel like doing
it, I even cover larger distances.
A Brompton owner must always start his or her day by making up the
itinerary to be covered during the day and considering whether to take the
bicycle or not. Rain is not a decisive factor unless the weather forecast
predicted it for the entire day. You can always carry the Brompton on the
way to work in the morning rain and ride on it on the way back in the
evening sun. What determines the need for the Brompton is the proportion of
the distance to be covered by foot and the distance feasible on your bike.
It does not make much sense to carry the bike in your hand for a total of
one hour if you only use it for five minutes on the way from home to the
subway station in the morning and back in the evening.
Some might think that these arguments are useless since you do not spend so
much time carrying your bicycle. If you know there is a longer distance
ahead, you just unfold it and ride! Unfortunately, this is true only in
ideal circumstances. If you do not have to stop anywhere and there is a
direct exit from the subway where you get off, you do not have to carry the
bike very far. But as soon as you want to do some shopping, especially
going from one shop to the other, or meet friends in the street and want to
go along with them to caf&eacute;s, bookshops etc., you are facing a dilemma:
should I leave my bicycle unfolded and attached to a rack outside, or
should I fold it and take it inside? Once I have it folded, should I unfold
it until I get to the next shop? Usually you will end up carrying the
bicycle with you, since the Brompton is too expensive to be left outside,
and anyway, why did you buy a foldable bicycle if you have to lock it to
racks? As for unfolding and folding it every time, fast as it may be, it is
nonetheless annoying if done so frequently. So if during the day you plan
to do area-limited activities with frequent movement like shopping you
better leave your Brompton at home or in a safe place.
In Paris, there is an additional factor that makes the combined use of
public transport and of the Brompton difficult. The car-centered concept of
urbanism that has been prevailing in this century sent the vast majority of
public transport underground. The subway system in Paris is perhaps the
most complex one in the world, with 13 subway lines and 4 underground
suburban trains converging in numerous points in the area delimited by the
peripheral highway. Ch&acirc;telet-les-Halles in the city center is the biggest
of all stations, three of the four suburban trains and the most important
subway lines cross here in what we may safely call an underground city with
a cultural and shopping center. In an area of approximately one square
kilometer all subway stations are linked by underground pedestrian
passages. If you get off your subway or train in this maze, it may well
take 10 to 15 minutes and several hundred meters before you see the sky
above your head. Needless to say, cycling and skating are forbidden in
these passages, where you often have to first go down in order to reach the
surface, taking stairs and escalators several times. And this is just one
of the dozen of places in the Parisian subway system where converging
subway lines create underground pedestrian labyrinths. To worsen the
situation, the automatic checkpoints for tickets are built in a way that
anybody carrying something larger than a handbag will find himself or
herself in trouble. The passages between the machines are way too narrow,
and sometimes you even have to cross several checkpoints when changing from
one line to the other. Using the subway system when arriving in Paris with
heavy luggage is a real nightmare. It is not much better having a Brompton
in your hands.
If a town is ever constrained to have recourse to the subway in order to
facilitate surface traffic (which is already something not recommended by
modern urban transport theories), at least they should make sure that from
any point in the stations there is a direct and easy access to the surface.
This is not only in the interest of travellers with luggage and Brompton
users, but also to ensure the general conviviality of life in that town.
The best way to deal with the situation in the current circumstances is to
acquire a good knowledge of the main stations and spot the nearest and
shortest exit to the surface, regardless of your destination. Once you are
on your unfolded bike things are much easier.
<H5>
3.2. Parking strategy
</H5>
You do not park a Brompton the way you do it with normal bicycles. Ideally
you always have it with you, since there are two good reasons that prevent
you from leaving it somewhere outside attached to a bicycle rack. It is too
valuable and it does not seem logical: having paid for a foldable bike, you
would be crazy not to profitate from its special features. So in you go
with it.
However, depending on the place where you have entered, it is sometimes
advisable to get rid of the bicycle inside. If you are in a cinema, concert
hall, theater, or even a restaurant, it is very likely that there will be a
cloakroom where they will be more than delighted to take care of a unique
foldable bicycle, a colorful spot in the eternal flow of coats and bags.
Chances are that even if there is no cloakroom, the employees of the
establishment will help you find a safe place to put your Brompton. If you
think the place is not safe enough, you can attach it to some tube or
stable piece of furniture with the chain you always carry in your bag. The
same thing can be done at your workplace.
If you meet negative reactions, do not insist. Just walk out of sight and
attach your bicycle in a discreet place in the building, or ultimately take
it with you and put it by the wall near your seat so that you can keep an
eye on it. This has happened to me only two or three times in one and a
half months. However, things have never gone as far as being explicitly
told to leave the bicycle in the street.
In supermarkets, it is a good idea to put the Brompton in your handcart and
push it around as if it was a child, provided you do not have to buy too
many things.
In cantines, you will quickly learn how to hold your tray with all the
dishes in one hand and carry the Brompton in the other.
<H5>
3.3. Public response
</H5>
This is the most difficult thing a new Brompton user has to get used to. No
matter in which position your bicycle is, folded, unfolded, or in-between,
it will always sollicitate the curious eyes and the remarks of bypassers.
In average I am stopped two times a day in the street or elsewhere by
people asking questions and admiring the bicycle. The two most frequent
remarks are 'It's practical, isn't?' and 'This is a folding bicycle!', as
if I was unaware of it. In the long run it is rather irritating. Some
people ask further questions, which concern mostly the weight and the price
of the bicycle, where it is sold, and also how safe and efficient it is to
ride on it. The conversation is usually interrupted when I say the price of
the bicycle. It is really THE discourageing factor for everybody.
As I have been involved in the work of different urban cyclist and
environmental associations, I am sensible to the fact that people who see
me use this bicycle automatically start thinking about transport issues in
their town, so I consider it as a good pedagogical tool.
<H5>
4. Comparison of the advantages of the Brompton and a normal city bicycle
</H5>
Advantages of the Brompton
<UL>
<LI>it does not get stolen since it is always with you
<LI>it is easy to store it at home or at work (ideal for appartments in
blocks of flats)
<LI>as a cyclist:
at any time you can switch from cycling to another mode of transport if
the weather turns bad, you are tired or you do not feel well, you have a
flat tyre, suddenly you have to go very far, the traffic becomes too dense
etc.
<LI>as a public transport user:
you can reduce walking times (to the station etc.)
<LI>it can be easily transported from one town to the other or on holidays by
plane, by car or by train
<LI>it helps raise public awareness of transport issues
<LI>it is easy to navigate between cars in a traffic jam because the wheels
are small
</UL>
<BR>
Advantages of a normal city bike
(=disadvantages of the Brompton)
<UL>
<LI>less expensive
<LI>since it is less expensive, you are not so worried about it and you can
leave it in a bicycle rack when doing shopping or meeting friends who do
not have a bicycle etc.
<LI>people do not bother you with silly questions when you use it
<LI>it may have more gears and may be more comfortable and faster (but not
necessarily)
<LI>you can carry a second person if necessary
<LI>it is less sensitive to the unevenness of the road surface
<LI>the rear wheel does not hang loose when you lift the bicycle
<LI>it is easier and less expensive to maintain and repair (spare parts etc.)
</UL>
<H4>
5. A glimpse into the future
</H4>
I realize that some of the features described above are closely related to
the premise that my Brompton is the only one around. If ever the novelty of
the bicycle is gone and more and more people start to use it, we will have
to rethink the whole issue again.
I try to imagine what it would be like if everybody had a Brompton-like
bicycle.
<UL>
<LI>special guarded or lockable storing places would have to be set up inside
the public institutions
<LI>public transport vehicles would have to be redesigned to accommodate both
the passengers and their 'luggage'
<LI>of course, the requests of the present-day urban cyclist associations
would have to be fulfilled all the same (bicycle infrastucture and
restrictions on car use).
</UL>
So it is not such a big investment. The major part of the change is to
happen in the portable bicycle manufacturers' attitude and in the habits of
people.

<H2 ALIGN=center>Brompton compared to other brands</H2>
<EM CLASS="from">Mike Hessey, Oct 1999:</EM><BR>
There are lots of comments on the Brompton and Birdy, and comparisons, on
the Folding Society web pages at <A HREF="http://www.whooper.demon.co.uk/foldsoc.">http://www.whooper.demon.co.uk/foldsoc.</A>

<H2><A NAME="25"></A>Brompton compared to Bike Friday</H2>
<UL>
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Leonard Rubin:</EM><BR>
Okay. Having owned several bicycle shops, sold every imaginable model of
folding bike, lived and ridden folding bikes in New York City, and finally
undertaken the much-publicized Super-Brompton development project
(<A CLASS="quick" HREF="Tricks.html#UFB">Tips, tricks & tinkering - Leonard Rubin's UFB ("Ultimate Folding Bike" or "Super-Brompton") project</A>), I'd like to take a crack at that question!
<OL>
<LI>The Brompton does indeed fold to a diminutive size, ("suitcase" would be
more realistic than "briefcase", though) small enough to unobtrusively tuck
under a table or stash in a cloak room. When in its instantly-deployed case
(cover), it would not suggest a bicycle, except to someone with exceptional
imagination (or who happens to own a Brompton).
<LI>The bike Friday is quite slow, awkward and messy to fold completely,
especially under pressure, and it is a cumbersome folded package to carry.
It is best suited to situations where performance is of paramount
importance, and quick-folding is of little importance. Long distance travel
would be an example.
</OL>
New York City commuting represents just the opposite sort of application.
The City is pretty flat, and  what is most important is being able to
quickly and  neatly make the bike disappear, to enter bike-hostile
buildings and board public transit smoothly throughout the day.
<BR>
I love the ride of the Brompton, but I would make a few equipment
substitutions,
including a quick-release on the handle-bar to allow quick adjustment
between a bit more forward position for efficient riding and instant return
to the upright position for folding. I also developed a superlight,
micro-adjust seatpost that permits more variation in fore-aft positioning.
A must-have is the front quick-disconnect rack/bag combination!
<BR>
After riding, selling, servicing and upgrading folders of every stripe for
more than a decade, I developed my own high-performance design. After
buying a Brompton (initially as a new curiosity to add to my collection), I
became so enamoured of the design I stopped making mine, and turned all my
attention to making high-performance modifications to the Brompton! I
believe the stock bike is the most compact, civilized, well-designed and
produced folding bike ever sold commercially, and I sell a variety of
add-ons and upgrade kits to enhance its performance.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Elaine Mari & Ming Dinh, Jan 1998:</EM><BR>
for those who know more about the differences than I do, I've seen the Bike
Fridays discussed on the net as being better for performance and long
distance applications than Bromptons.  Is this due only to tyres and riding
position?  Because these can be changed on the Brompton.  Has anyone seen
first hand their new models, the ones that have a fold down stem to fold
super fast?  I gather the folded sizes are quite large compared to
Bromptons.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Steven D. Hanel, Jan 1998:</EM><BR>
I have a Bike Friday and a Brompton and they each have their place.
Depends on how often or fast the fold needs to be. I have taken my
Brompton on week trips where it gets hundred miles or so, gets folded
alot when I take it into restaurants, cars, offices, hotels without the
hassle of a lock. The Bike Friday does have a wider gear range and they
do build them to your preferred dimensions. Bike Fridays also have a
quick fold but it is no where near as fast OR SMALL as the Brompton.
They don't have rear suspension and adding suspension stems and
seatposts isn't quite the same as the Brompton suspension. I do ride the
Brompton more. At least until I make the recumbent conversion for the
Bike Friday or maybe the almost mythical Brompton conversion will be
released first (my workload is fairly full).
<LI><EM CLASS="from">David Cox, Jan 1998:</EM><BR>
I run both a Brompton and a BF. BF is a better ride because of its 21
speeds, more rigid frame, superior wheels and V brakes. It really is nearly
as fast for touring as my Mercian Classic (about 1 mph slower on a morning
ride average).
<BR>
It will also fold into a hard case with effort.
<BR>
However, its quick fold format into the bag is pretty hopeless compared to
the Brompton. It takes longer, is less positive and you are left with the
handlebars floating around on the brake cables and needing to be just
stuffed down between the wheels. The package is too big to fit behind the
seats on British railways and takes up all the space and requires removal
of parcel shelf in the boot/trunk of our hatchback Golf.
<BR>
I use the Brompton for commuting, trains to London, smuggling into meetings
or as escape vehicle on family visits in the car. I am expecting the new BF
to be better for touring Marin County at Easter or Tuscany in the summer.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Mark Maier, Jan 1998:</EM><BR>
As Steve Hanel wrote, both bikes have their place. I also own both and
think that the shortest way to express this is to say the Brompton is
a "FOLDING bike" and the Friday is a "folding BIKE". This doesn't mean

there is a folding tandem, too.

I enjoy riding the Brompton and a Friday but in different ways. On the
Friday I can go faster and climb hills better. It has a more sporting
riding position, it is more rigid, has more gears, better brakes. Mine is
set up as a touring bike but can cope with some off road trails. I can keep
up with Sunday club runs on it. Only a stripped down racing bike is faster
and you can set up a Friday with narrow tyres and lighter components. It
will also go into a standard suitcase. However, it is a pain to fold and in
quick fold form takes up a lot of space and is awkward to carry.
<BR>
The Brompton has a character all of its own. It is fun to fold, goes
anywhere, creates little offence and wins friends and influences people,
its got a neat front carrier system - this is a reason alone to use it for
shopping, commuting, going to meetings etc. Ideal for trains or smuggling
in car boots, it will also fly in its soft bag with some pipe warmer
padding. You can push along at highish speeds but my average speeds are
slower on a Brompton L3 than on most of my other bikes - a heavy mountain
bike done up for commuting is no faster. However, the bike goes where it is
pedalled in a purposeful manner and this encourages a pottering,
sightseeing style of riding, ideal for commuting, exploring cities or the
countryside. I've done 30-40 mile rides with weekend luggage and some
people have done 100 miles in a day. There is even someone who has claimed
to have averaged 17 mph from Belfast to Dublin on a group ride on one. The
ride is gentler than the Friday - or any other bike I've used and it is
very easy to manoeuvre. The Brompton leads you into a different view of
transport and another dimension of cycling - I use trains and get lifts
more, dont worry about punctures - I can always get to appointments by
taxi. It is that rarity a vehicle made in England by a British company -
I've never wanted a Reliant Robin and VW have taken over Rolls.

<H2><A NAME="26"></A>Brompton compared to Birdy</H2>
<UL>
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Leonard Rubin:</EM><BR>
The Birdy is a terrific-riding, fair-folding, cool and lightweight
bike. The suspension is incredible. The riding position is pretty
stretched-out, which is great for long torsos and performance-style riding,
but objectionable to some shorter-torso'ed folk and the more casual rider.
The folding can't hold a candle to the Brompton--it's larger, more awkward,
not as neat a package and doesn't wheel when folded. It's quite light,
though, and with some component upgrades can be made intoxicatingly light,
as the aluminum frame is much lighter than the Brompton. The anti-dive
front suspension is among the very best I've ridden! The   seven-speed
derailleur gearing is also lighter and more efficient than a Sturmey-Archer
hub.
<BR>
Still, it won't accommodate a front derailleur and multiple chainrings,
like my custom Brompton, as the frame geometry (and material) and folding
design prohibit such modifications--an important consideration to S.F.
riders like myself!
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Thorsten Rentel, Apr 1998:</EM><BR>
I had the opportunity to ride a Birdy. The whole concept is more aimed
at people, that want a ride more comparable to a mtb (there's mtb tyres
available and some people use their birdys off-road, even in races!) or
city-bike and don't mind the slightly larger dimensions when folded. The
full-suspension is adjustable (3 different elastomers) and provides a
lot of comfort. The riding position is less upright, but there is
another stem (height-adjustable and about 2,5 inch closer to the rider)
available.
It doesn't handle as easy as the Brompton when folded as it lacks the
little wheels to roll along the folded package. Due to this and the
larger dimensions it is probably less suited to the train commuter.
Luggage capacity is smaller (two different optional racks, one
suspended, the other not) and the mudguards (optional) are a little
short and a bit on the flimsy side, but still functional.
Other options include different bags and lightings. I don't know whether
all the options and addons are available everywhere.
The overall built quality is very good, apart from the already mentioned
mudguards.
There's 4 different models: red (7-gear alivio, 1890,-DM), green (inter7
with belt-drive and backpedal-brake, 2090,-DM), blue (21-gear Sachs 3x7,
2390,-DM) and elox (8-gear XT, 3190,-), Prices are Deutschmark, check
the rates.
<BR>
Yes, prices are high. But if it suits your purpose it's a very
attractive package.

If you are thinking about buying a folder, you must establish your priorities:
convenient folding & folded size versus mechanical efficiency/distance to
travel
quality of specification and both of the above versus price limit.
<BR>
I have had a Brompton for about 2-3 years and ride around London regularly.  I
recently bought a Birdy at nearly twice the price for speed, comfort, distance
but not for folding.  I use my Birdy for longer journeys, where I can travel
light and where some is on off road tracks and my Brompton for commuting, load
carrying (one of its leading attributes!) and when I will need to fold/unfold
alot (one day's commuting involves 12 folds or unfolds).
<BR>
My advice is: if the Brompton price is your limit -get it, if you can afford
more and folding time/size is not your highest priority, then look at a Birdy
or a Friday.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">David Edge, Aug 1998:</EM><BR>
The Birdy does ride better. You don't need to swerve in front of cars to
avoid potholes. Slightly longer folded than Brompton, but a little lighter.
<BR>
Disadvantages:
Twice as expensive (in the UK)
Non-standard tyres (but can be rebuit with Brompton wheels)
Maybe less durable - not recommended for people over 90kg
<BR>
I was 118kg, now 98 so still have Brompton. Suggest you get a suitcase or
box the size of a folded Birdy, put 20kg in it and carry it around for a
day or two on public transport! You'll know then.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Bob Gelman, Aug 1998:</EM><BR>
For the information of those of you not in the US, the price of
Brompton and Birdy here is almost the same (Birdy at REI after 10%
dividend is $900), making the Birdy much more competitive in comparison
shopping in the USA.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Peter ?, Aug 1998:</EM><BR>
Price-wise in the states they're roughly slightly more expensive (the Burley
models)
<BR>+++ the Birdy front end is suspended;  the rear end has three different
replacable suspension cushions.
<BR>--- there's no Birdy space for luggage.  The Brompt has that great front
pannier.
<BR>+++ the Birdy has a quick-release gizmo for the handlebar stem.  I hope
Brompton can imitate, or improvise (get folding down to 8 secs)
<BR>
As a side thought, buying a brompton first may make it easier to trade up to a
birdy, since the Brompton is in such high demand.  Buying the Birdy and
trading down (up) to a Brompton  would mean unloading the Birdy wich may be
marginally more difficult.  I suspect you'd be less likely to wantr to sell
the Brompton for a Birdy though.  If you do get the Birdy and wish to trade
up, I do live in the Bay Area.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Thorsten Rentel, Aug 1998:</EM><BR>
At least in Europe there's two rack options for the birdy, one mounted
on the rear swinarm (unsuspended, Brompton-style), the other mounted at
the seatpost bolt (suspended, folds automatically and doesn,t enlarge
the folded package). Both cost around 60 Dollar.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Bob Gelman, Oct 1998:</EM><BR>
And why do I feel vulnerable without the Brompton - well, none of the
others has that ease of folding which is so valuable if the need
suddenly arises to rush off somewhere with the help of a train, perhaps
<BR>
Before I got my Birdy I studied the "foldability" of the 3
leading Bikes.  I agree with you that Friday certainly has limitations
in this department.  However, I found very little difference in folding
ease, speed, and utility between Brompton and Birdy.
<BR>
I'm sure any experienced Birdy folder can do the trick within a very
few seconds of Brompton's.  When we're talking about 15-20 seconds for
the Birdy, I can't imagine that any difference in speed, if there is
one, is particularly significant here anyway.
<BR>
While Brompton has wheels, Birdy is light enough to be carried more
easily, and flops around less when lifted.
<BR>
Both are small enough to go most anywhere.  A Birdy with folding pedal
wouldn't be so much larger than Brompton to give it less utility for
storage, etc.   Where would Brompton have an advantage here (folded
size)? Neither fits easily in the truck (boot)(a/k/a "rear glove
compartment") of my Miata.  Both easily fit in the front passenger
seating area.
<BR>
Many, although this is subjective, would find Birdy to be a vastly
superior ride over Brompton (including lower and better gearing);
while this isn't particularly significant for very short, flat, commuter
runs.
I agree that the carrying basket for Brompton has advantages, if
required.
<BR>
However, I think the main advantange for Brompton, in the UK at least,
is price.

<H2><A NAME="27"></A>Brompton compared to Bike Friday and Birdy</H2>
<UL>
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Mike Hessey, Oct 1998:</EM><BR>
The Brompton folds superbly, and is easy to carry, though not especially
light. But the riding position is less than ideal for most people,
myself included, in that it is very upright with the bars closer to the
saddle than most people want. So its great for commuting where you need
to fold and unfold 4 times a day, but on longer journeys it is less
comfortable due to the riding position than some other bikes. You can
ride it longer distances of course, but it's less enjoyable. I've ridden
mine 65 miles in a day, and on the century ride I did with the Henshaws
earlier this year David and Jane did 100 miles each on their Bromptons.
I used my Friday, and Peter Henshaw was on a Birdy. Although I'm much
older than them, I thin I was in better condition at the end of the ride
than they were (apart from injuries suffered when I was clumsy enough to
fall off), due entirely to having a bike with more gears and better
suited to the length of the ride. Another excellent feature of the
Brompton is the luggage carrying capacity.
<BR>
The Birdy gives a more comfortable riding position, and with front and
rear suspension is more comfortable over longer distances. But it
doesn't fold nearly as conveniently as a Brompton and is quite a bit
bigger when folded, though a bit lighter than production Bromptons. It
also has rather poor luggage carrying facilities by comparison with the
Brompton, the unusual 18 inch tyres are not very good for either rolling
resistance or life, and it tends to rattle and squeak, emphasised I
think by the aluminium frame.
<BR>
The Friday is a relatively simple and conventional bike, which has no
suspension but gives a very conventional and comfortable riding
position, will take standard front and rear panniers (with the right
carriers fitted) and uses the common 20 inch wheel format, for which
some superb tyres are available. But folding is still less convenient
than the Birdy, and even though it can be folded and covered in less
than 1 minute with practice, the resultant package is very bulky. It
does of course offer a more elaborate fold/separation option which
enables it to be fitted into a special suitcase for air travel, which is
convenient for some (Air ... models actually separate down to carry on
luggage size for air travel, but this too is a slow process).
<BR>
To cover the subject properly would take a lot more space than I have
used here - I have tried to be as brief as possible. You can find out
more by studying the web pages, reading back issues of The Folder and A
to B, talking to other owners etc.  Different people prefer different
folders, because they use them for different purposes. Do remember the
fact that they are all design compromises, and there is therefore no
single best folder which does every job best - you need to identify the
one which suits your particular requirements most closely.
<BR>
And why do I feel vulnerable without the Brompton - well, none of the
others has that ease of folding which is so valuable if the need
suddenly arises to rush off somewhere with the help of a train, perhaps
with a portable computer in the front bag, and with a minimum of fuss.
It's been described as the equivalent of a Swiss Army Knife, and it is -
it can do most things, though more specialised tools will often do
individual jobs better.

I too owned a Hon, though seven years ago.  I now own a Brompton.  The

<LI><EM CLASS="from">Jerry Kaidor, Oct 1997:</EM><BR>
Just as a data point - I have a friend who has three Dahons.  I let

<LI><EM CLASS="from">alex mumzhiu, Dec 1999:</EM><BR>
Dahon is a strange company. Year after year they  systematically eliminate
good features of their bikes and  introduce bad ones.  On the frame of the
bike they put the warning  "Not intended for curb jumping or other hard
usage". Contrary to this warning the bike is surprisingly sturdy.  However
they changed the design of the lock which holds the  handlebar after it is
unfolded, from a good design to a bad one. In my last three trips this lock
was  broken, and my wife had to send me a new one across the globe. The
distance between the handle bar and the seat is too short.  It is impossible
to keep proper positioning for biking. Fortunately I saved a curved seat
post from a very early model, which increases this distance and allows to
maintain proper biking positioning.    A good feature of Dahon is its tires.
They are wider then Brompton's and as a result of this they works better as
a shock  absorbers. These tires are the only  design feature which I miss.
Also they are the same size as children's bike tires and are available
everywhere. These children bike tires make the bike funny looking which
attracts a lot of attention, so when my wife or daughter ride Dahon they
always came back with lots of interesting propositions.  However Dahon is
moving toward 20 inch  tires and the  newer Dahon bikes are  all 20inch
models.

<H2><A NAME="29"></A>Brompton compared to Strida</H2>
<UL>
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Andras / Barnabas Toth, Apr 1998:</EM><BR>
The Strida I had the occasion to try did not have any gears. The chain of
the bicycle was made of rubber, and everything else seemed to be made of
plastic. However, this did not significantly reduce its weight compared to
the Brompton: according to its owner, it weighs 10 kg. The wheels were a
little smaller than the Brompton's. The overall riding sensation was very
unstable and quite inefficient. The whole frame was balancing from left to
right as I was pedalling. However, I did not have trouble with my legs at
all, there was enough space. When I sat on it, I had the impression of
riding one of those ancient bikes with the giant front wheels, because
contrarily to the Brompton, the frame protrudes up from the seat to the
level of the handlebar. The folding is done in a single movement but is
limited to the length of the bicycle: there is not any reduction in the
height. The folded bike can be pushed on one wheel and gives the impression
of a hand-held mine-detector.
As for the price, the owner said he had bought it in England for the
equivalent of 2800 French franks (approximately 470 USD, check the current
exchange rates), but I am not quite sure I remember well, so do not rely on
this information.
This is all I can say because I did not ask for the owner's address and
chances are that we will never again see each other.
If there is an advice I can give you, you should be happy you have a
Brompton and forget about Strida.

Some design details on the old Brompton which are notable by change
<BR>
1) The sharp kink in the main frame
<BR>
2) The 1" headset
<BR>
3) The clamp & split in front of seat tube, which proved a serious stress
point, with heavy riders (ie JG and DH and porbably if he'd had one RC/DE) and
often fractures - but can be re-brazed.
<BR>
4) The rigid frame carrier and lighter pivot connection on rear traingle - one
enhances strength, the other is a weakness, which like 2) carried over to
early machines on the new production run, before the upgrade to 1.25"
headseat, and reduced stress raiser rear pivot arrangement.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Rob Cope, Apr 1999:</EM><BR>
Comparing '99 & '82 Bromptons, the later one will be noticeably lighter,
both from frame improvements & more use of alloy (espec the rims).  The
forks are better formed & of chrome-moly, not high tensile steel.  The
rear triangle uses fatter stronger tubes & has a couple more braces eg
between the stalks mounting the front pulley-wheels.  The rear carrier
(if fitted) is alloy.
<BR>
The brakes may be inferior, with Saccons replacing the discontinued CLB
callipers.  I presume you have steel wheels (& front hub).  The chain
tensioner is functionally the same, rather better moulded (though you
may have a really early model with handmade tensioner).
<BR>
Check the handlebars.  The polished alloy ones with a shim in the stem
tend to break along the edges of that shim.  Newer bars (with a built in
oversize centre) seem stronger, though not wholly unbreakable.
<BR>
The 3-speed hasn't changed much, though you probably have an oil-lubed
model with proper seals & an oil filler. Current 3-speeds are greased to
save fitting the seals, which works fine till the grease evaporates &
you have to dismantle to regrease (or inject oil down the hollow axle).

I find the rack on the T type very useful for less arduous
excursions. My toolkit and spare tyre fit into a pack under the seat.
Then my coat can be rolled up and put on the rack. There is then no
need for a pannier. Without the front pannier I am not tempted to
take useless things along for the ride. The rack is also useful for
carrying things when one runs out of space in the front luggage.

Against this is the extra weight when carrying the bike and when
cycling.

Very useful for some things, little use for others.

It is good for carrying a folded up coat, letters and other post, a box

It very much depends how hilly it is! I recall that East Lothian, like

higher gears are also great for zipping along the flat. The additional ?80
is well worth it.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Phil Gough:</EM><BR>
Go for the T3.  I use my T5 for the sort of riding you describe,always carrying  a

of downhill speed occasionally. [...]
Unless of course East Lothian is a very hilly part of Scotland!
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Anthony "you can't have too many gears" Cartmell:</EM><BR>
I'd recommend the T5.  IMHO the extra choice of gears is well worth the
extra money.  The current Sturmey-Archer five speed gears are probably
as robust as the three speeds (but are slightly heavier?).  Even for
short journeys it's amazing how often you meet strong winds and steep
hills, and who knows where your Bromptons will take you in the future...
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Andrew Henry:</EM><BR>
I was faced with the same decision.  Both hubs weigh the same.
The gear change with the 3 speed is a bit slower - you have
to consciously stop pedalling before the change is made.  With
the 5 speed, you can just ease off a little.
<BR>
The downsides with the five speed are that it is newer, so the
long term reliability isn't as well proven as with the 3 speed.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Stein Somers:</EM><BR>
I used to be suspicous about the Sturmey Archer 3 speed hub (SA3),
because of the problems I had with it.  (I didn't use it properly
though).
The main problem was the failure mode: the SA3 would drop in between
gears when you were pushing hard on the peddles, so there was nothing
stopping you anymore, except certain body parts hitting hard metal.
<BR>
So I was even more worried about the SA5.  I did purchase a T5
(recently, with a single cable).
It got misadjusted in the beginning (the locker nut was not tightened),
but didn't fall in between gears, it just doubted between gears.
I immediately corrected it and it's still fine after 1500 km.
So, regardless of the number of gears, I definitely prefer the SA5.
It switches between gears more easily as well.
<BR>
I also know of one major drawback of the SA5: I slipped and fell
on the first ice of this winter, and the SA5 gear controller broke.
It is plastic (junk), whereas my old SA3 used to have a decent metal
controller.  And I had to pay (the equivalent of) 14 pound sterling
for a replacement!
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Peter Amey:</EM><BR>
The current T5s have only one cable for the Sturmey Archer and it is no
more difficult to remove than the 3-speed (it does require a bit more
accuracy when adjusting).
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Malcolm Lyon:</EM><BR>
The latest [5-speed] Sturmey hub is called 'The Sprinter'
and is controlled by a single cable.
A feature of this is that it has no 'slipping position' -
the gears are continuously in 'drive' whilst changing up or down.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Phil Gough:</EM><BR>
my T5 is an elderly model fitted with the old twin cable SA-5/2 hub -
which, incidentally, despite being maligned by
some is still perfectly satisfactory after 8 years
and nearly 10,000 miles of use.
But in truth, it got a lot better
when one of the later rear fork assemblies was fitted, as this
allowed much better alignment of the cables and less friction in use.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Meryl Prestidge:</EM><BR>
why does the Folder keep saying the gears on a
T5 are not adequate in hilly regions?  I'm in Plymouth, UK and my T5
with 18% gear reduction seems fine so far.  21 might be better, but 5
do the job.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Carl Etnier:</EM><BR>
[...] the guy at the shop warned me not to get a T5. If the hub fails, he
said, you're shpxrq.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Peter Amey:</EM><BR>
I don't think the 5-speed Sprinter (single cable) hubs are inherently more
of a problem than 3-speeds and they are just as easy to service.
<BR>
Having said that I have just found mine to be very (very) badly worn
internally after rather less service than I think it ought to have given.
I sent a FAX to Sturmey Archer this morning saying that the wear was too
high and they called about an hour ago to offer me a free replacement set
of internal parts;  pretty good service I would say.
<BR>
My only regret about the more recent hub gears is the lack of an oil port.
I know the greased-and-sealed-for-life arguments well but remain convinced
that a regular weekly flooding with oil is a better solution for hub
gear longevity.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Leonard Rubin:</EM><BR>
Many years ago I used to own bicycle shops in New England, and used to
specialize in all things Sturmey Archer. The five speed hubs were always
much more fussy than the good ol' AW (venerable three speed model). They
have much shorter indicator chain (that's the proper name for the little
chain that pulls the rod that moves the gears inside the hub) travel
between gears, and it's hard enough to hold the adjustment on a non-folding
bike! Alignment is indeed critical, as the use of a good quality cable,
housing, lever and lubricant throughout the system. There used to be a few
different lengths of indicator rods (the bit inside the hub that is
attached to the indicator chain, sometimes I found a manufacturer used the
wrong length rod for a particular axle/nuts configuration, though I am not
suggesting that is the case here.

I've got a T3 (three-speed without any gear reduction) and find that
climbing gradients steeper than 10% is difficult -  the Brompton isn't the
sort of bike where you can come out of the saddle when the going gets
steep. If you're planning to do hills frequently you might want to consider
a 5-speed or one of Brompton's gear-reduction options.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">David Henshaw, Mar 98:</EM><BR>
My 3-speed regularly undertakes journeys of 30 miles or
so, and we've ridden 60-70 without ill effects. This is in moderately
hilly country too. The secret is in the choice of gear ratios - they are
spot on.
So my advice would be - go for the little bike with minimal gears and a
big heart. But make sure to fit a decent saddle and Primo high-pressure
tyres.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Custfold, Apr 1998:</EM><BR>
For proven reliability use the 3-speed which in AW form has remained
virtually unchanged in design for over 60 years - and some 60 year old
versions are still going strong.
<BR>
The 5 speed has more bits = more bits to go wrong
<BR>
There have been several 2 cable versions - the SA5 and 5-star spring to mind
as both have been on the Brompton, then we got the 1 cable Sprinter with the
C**p plastic changer which wears out - and the rather fine adjustmant of the
cable to make the 2 stage sliding dog work.
<BR>
As the 5 speed has this larger sliding dog bit there is a bigger slot in the
axle -making it weaker - and I've bust several 5 speeds against only 1 AW
which was when I was 14 and through crass incompetence rather than loading.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Tom Bennett, Aug 1999:</EM><BR>
I'm glad I bought the 5 gear model.  In cycling around France this
summer, I used all five gears regularly.  I never biked at night in the
country, so I had no need for the T model.  Also, the Pannier system worked
perfectly well, so I never needed a rack for the rear wheel.  Therefore, I
recommend buying an L5 with the Pannier system.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Peter O'Reilly, Oct 1999:</EM><BR>
I live in Manhattan as well and have an L5 with no gear reduction.
<BR>
I opted for the 5 speed due to the obvious reason of a greater variety of
gears, but I think the 3 speed is more than adequate for Manhattan. For
longer excursions, you may find the extra gears to be of great benefit.
<BR>
As for no gear reduction, I opted for that since my body is accustomed to
riding a bicycle.  Channell persuaded me to not go for reduced gearing -
which was on the mark indeed.  Although, I did hedge my bets and purchased a
rear sprocket for something like $5.  (It's still in the wrapper and not
likely to be used at this point).
<BR>
With all that said, I rarely use the 4th gear.  Out of pure curiousity I
tried out the 5th gear once on my Brompton.  At the speed 4th or 5th gear
dictates (20+ mph?), I'd personally prefer to coast down a hill given the
design and intedend use of the Brompton coupled with urban road conditions
and traffic.  To that end perhaps reduced gearing would be of benefit -
allowing a greater range of gearing for gears that will be *frequently*
used.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Stein Somers, Oct 1999:</EM><BR>
In '96 I opted for the 5 speed and never regretted it.  I reject the
statement that 3 gears is enough for Manhattan.  I've never been
anywhere near to it, but I remember it being close to sea, so even if it
is flat as a dime the wind will compensate for that. Also recent
activities, be they labourous or social events, can greatly influence
the gear chosen.  Anyway, I'd rather use the 5 speed's 3 middle gears
than the 3 speed's widely spaced gearing.  I think you limit your
Brompton to a 3 speed only if you have a particular reason to: being
exceptionally strong, lacking in cash, plannig to transport the Brompton
more than ride...
<LI><EM CLASS="from">David Cox, Oct 1999:</EM><BR>
I reckon that the cheapest L3 is fine for Manhattan, I had a good 3 days
riding around the island Memorial weekend and never felt the need for more
or lower gears. The 3 speed is still in my humble opinion Sturmey's best
ever product - reliable and easy to adjust.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Julie Kosicki, Oct 1999:</EM><BR>
I agree with [3 gears], unless you happen to carry heavy-ish loads (e.g
camping gear) and / or tend towards knee ache.  I carry a lot of paper files
and overnight gear on mine and now and again (age rather than riding
position) get the odd bit of knee pain.  So I find the extra two gears and
lower gearing very handy, even on the relatively gentle slopes of much of
London, but most definitely in the hilly district where I live.  If you're
travelling around the country on your Brompton or abroad, the extra gears
would certainly be a good investement : You're bound to meet a challenging
hill sooner or later.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Reuben Winitch, Oct 1999:</EM><BR>
I used to have the L5 and now I have an L3.  I was much happier with the extra
gears.  Neither were reduced.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Jim McLaughlin, Oct 1999:</EM><BR>
I have the 50/14, although I will probably switch back to the 13 tooth.  When I
was in the mountains with a 50 pound trailer and the temperature was over 100
degrees F, I put a 36 tooth in front.  That was low enough to prevent heat
stroke.  The lowest gear was about 11 inches with the 36 tooth, low enough to
spin out at 2 or 3 miles per hour.  After about 40 miles of riding in the
mountain heat I was surprised that I felt a lower gear yet would be useful on
those 3 mile long ascents.

For all it's worth, if you are buying
a 5-speed Brompton, we would certainly recommend the full 18% reduction.
We have ridden our 3-speed machines in San Francisco without any
reduction, so we know what the hills are like, and would probably prefer
lower gears if we cycled in S F every day.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Andew Mackay:</EM><BR>
I have tried the 0%, 12% and 18% reductions and from the description
of what the type of riding to be attempted I would strongly suggest a 12 %
reduction.  Since the bike is not to be used for touring and the down-hill
speed is not of the essence, the most benefit of the gearing can be
obtained from a lower ratio to allow pedalling up the steepish San
Francisco hills.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Phil Gough:</EM><BR>
The human legs are a pretty good and flexible gear system.
After about a month you won't need those lowered gears and will able

I live near the top of Highgate Hill in North London - the highest
point in London.  I found that the 12.5 % reduction was pretty
successful in making the hill manageable with a Three Speed Brompton.
<BR>    <BR>
The hill however is so long that my stamina runs out at the end of a
days work, and I sometimes walk the last part.  Having borrowed a
multi- speed non-folder I realise that the gearing doesn't actually
make the hill go away - the problem is me and my general condition.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Tom Bennett, Aug 1999:</EM><BR>
I recommend the 12 % gear reduction.  With the original gearing, I spent
most of my time in gears 1,2, and 3, and no time in 4 or 5.  With 12%
reduction, I found myself using all the gears.  It seems to be an axiom that
easier gears are a necessity, whereas harder ones are a luxury.  I don't find
myself zooming downhill, craving more speed nearly as often as I find myself
puffing uphill, desirous of less stress.  My elfish wife has the 18%
reduction, which she finds excellent, but is slightly too easy for me.  I am
6 feet tall and very athletic.  Nevertheless, I found myself using first gear
quite often.  My observation is that European cyclists tend to spend more
time in harder gear, where Americans prefer to keep those legs spinning fast.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Nico J. de Boer, Aug 1999:</EM><BR>
[...] the reduced gearing (42 teeth front, 14 teeth back) only gives
you one low gear extra (as compared to the original 50-13 T5), and this
is completely inadequate for unathletic people like us to be able to
cycle uphill with luggage (2.5kg front, 14kg back). On hills steeper
than 15% we had to push instead of cycle. Maybe for the really strong a
42-14 T5 is all they need, but for us there is no alternative but to
start saving for a Swiss Mountain Drive. (Any Bromptoneers having
experience with luggage and a Mountain Drive?)
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Jim McLaughlin, Aug 1999:</EM><BR>
I pulled a 50 pound trailer through the Appalacians this summer in 100+ degree
F heat.  In addition to the mountain drive, I dropped the front chainring to
36 tooth (I think it is 14 in back still).  My target was to keep my heart
rate below 135 and I just barely did so in the heat.  If I recall, that range
was about 10.5 to 64 gear inches.  Now that I have the 50 tooth back on the
front, I think it is around 15 to 89 gear inches.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">De Clarke, Aug 1999:</EM><BR>
What Channell told me, untechnically, was that if you
bike anywhere that is not absolutely flat, you want
the 18 percent reduction.
<BR>
Having ridden the bike with 18% reduction I agree
with him :-)
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Chris Newport, Sep 1999:</EM><BR>
Despite the availability of 12% and 18% reductions and people saying
they 'never use 5th gear' etc. etc. I personally spend > 90% of my time
in 5th (commuting between Kew and the City of London daily - pretty flat
except for Holland Park Avenue), < 5% in 1st, my legs generate more
torque than power and I generally often find myself wanting a 6th gear.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Stein Somers, Oct 1999:</EM><BR>
I'm down from the standard 50/13 set-up
to 50/14 and still slightly long for a smaller chainring.  I favour a 14
tooth sprocket because it's better a keeping the chain from jumping off
(probably also at keeping you from putting it back should it happen
anyway), wears slower, and should be more efficient. However I
understand only the 18% reduction includes this 14 tooth sprocket and
18% seems a bit too slow to me.  12% reduction is 44/13 and 18%
reduction is 44/14.  At least in Europe, 46 teeth fixed chainring are
very common, but they don't (all) fit on a Brompton, so it's not easy to
change the chainring.  The sprockets are hard to find anyway, whether 13
or 14 tooth.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Giles Robinson, Oct 1999:</EM><BR>
Gosh, I'm tempted to say "beware high gear evangelists", but I'm sure the
intention is good.  I have a 12% reduced T5 and use : 2nd, 3rd, 4th more or
less equally; 1st quite often, going up steepish hills it is certainly
easier than 2nd; 5th almost never.  I almost regret not getting the 18%,
but the 12% 5th does have its uses.  We do have hills in
Manchester/Stockport (UK), but it's mostly pretty flat.
<BR>
When buying, I compared potential Brompton gear ratios to those I use most
often on my other bikes -- do this if possible.  If (like me) you prefer to
twiddle than push, the Brompton default setting will look too high.
<BR>
Some people just seem to be able to go fast, I wish I were one of them.  A
Brompton occasionally used to pass me on the way home from work, & I
couldn't catch it (on my touring bike).
I have two T5, both bought with standard transmission. Main advantage is
that
3rd gear, where the hubs internal efficiency is best, reaches high enough
for
most cruising. Various Experts recommend pedalling about 90 rpm, which is
above 27 km/h In 3rd gear. 4th and 5th gear are left for going downhill or
with
favourable winds. I changed the rear sprocket on both bikes to 14 teeth,
giving
8% reduction. This requires an extra pair of links in the chain, giving 100
links.
That is twice as much as the teeth on the chainring and, in theory, causes
additional wear of the chain. Even with that transmission I had not much use
for
5th gear. Some weeks ago I converted to 18% reduction by changing the
chainring to 44 teeth (no, it was not worn:) . I am perfectly happy with it.
I find the
standard transmission suitable in summer on a lonely cycle-path with
favourable
winds and 120 Psi in the Primo tires, but riding in city traffic with
dynamo, rain
jacket and facing winds I feel I cannot save 2 of 5 gears for rare
occasions.
Best advice is to compare the transmissions availiable by Brompton to that
You
favour on Your current bike. Even if that leads to false conclusions,
conversion is
simple.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">R. Maynard, Oct 1999:</EM><BR>
I'd endorse this. I've had an L5 with 18% gear reduction for about 2
months. Around Dublin (mostly flat) I rarely felt the need for a higher
gear. Here in Seattle (hilly) I often use the lowest gear.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Jim McLaughlin, Oct 1999:</EM><BR>
The thought of using 5th gear 90% of the time makes my knees hurt.  But I'm not
young and can't maintain 20 mph for more than a few miles.  And I'm determined to
never see a knee surgeon.
<BR>
I wonder if it is understood that 1st and 5th are the same gears running backwards
and forwards so to speak.  So the efficiency is similar.  There are technical
drawings at sturmey-archer.com
<BR>
In my humble opinion, you can never have enough gears unless you never go anywhere
or carry any loads or hit any winds or hills.  If you do none of those things, you
must not have a bike.  Someday we'll have ergonomic front wheel drive folding
recumbents with light, efficient transmissions spanning a ten to one range with
steps of 8%.  That would be at least 30 gears with no overlap.  Meanwhile, get as
many as you can afford.  It's much more important than, say, a fast computer.
<BR>
But please, folks, try to keep your pedaling cadence up to 80 rpm or at least 70
rpm most of the time.  It will keep you riding for many more years than grinding
away in a too high gear.  You'll get used to it, albeit slowly.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Matt Hayworth, April 2000:</EM><BR>
At first I
thought I had made a mistake in getting the T5 and 18% reduced gearing (since

I could see why someone might want a greater range at the bottom end.

<H3><A NAME="Taiwan"></A>Taiwan</H3>
<EM CLASS="from">Steven M. Scharf, Jan 1998:</EM><BR>
Ever since I first saw a Brompton at the 1995 Taipei International
Bicycle Show I wanted one. In January 1998 I was back in Taipei on
business and decided to try to buy one.

<H4>Neobike</H4>
Not everyone knows that Brompton licensed a Taiwanese company
called Neobike to manufacture and sell the Brompton in Asia.
The whole story is quite complex as the founder of Neobike was
employed by another Taiwanese folding bicycle company who sent
him to the U.K. to arrange the deal. The employee quit and started
Neobike and made the deal with Brompton to manufacture the
bike in Taiwan (this is the story I heard anyway).

<H4>Price</H4>
At the time of the 1995 bike show, the Taiwanese made L3TS was
retailing for about US$300. But due to the strong dollar the
price has fallen in $US; I paid $235. The L3TS is kind of a
cross between a L3 and a T3. It includes a rear rack but no
lights. It also includes a zippered Brompton logo carry bag,
the left folding pedal, and a frame pump.

<H4>Quality</H4>
I have heard reports that the Taiwan manufactured Bromptons
are of lower quality than the English built units. This may
be true. I am having trouble adjusting the rear fender to
prevent it rubbing the rear wheel; it may be due to a lower
quality rear brake set that prevents the fender from being
high enough over the wheel. I have given up for now and
removed the fender, but I think by some cutting of plastic
under the brake set I can get it to work satisfactorily.

<H4>Neobike Office</H4>
The Neobike export office was a ten minute walk from my hotel
but they were no help. They never returned e-mail or phone
calls and when I went to the office no one was there that day.
<BR>
Neobike Office: 112 Chung Shan Road N. Section 2, 3rd Floor, Room A =
(turn left from hallway with the elevators, go to the end of the hall).
Neobike has a desk in room A.
Note that the entrance to the building's upper floors is around to the
right down an alley from the main entrance of 112 which is a bank.
Phone 2 5413253.

<H4>Taipei Retailer</H4>
Fortunately I had saved a list of Taipei bicycle shops handed
out by the Brompton people at the bike show three years earlier.
They had circled one shop that carried the Brompton (all in
Chinese characters and with no phone number). I had my hotel
look up the phone numnber of the shop. I called them (they spoke
English fortunately) and they said that they did have a Brompton
in stock. I went over there to check it out. They had only a
sickly green one in stock but they told me they could get a red
one by the next day, and they followed through with their promise.
<BR>
I picked it up on Saturday morning and took it back to my hotel.
They had the shipping box which was helpful for shipping it home
on the plane (no charge).
<BR>
Shop name: David Bicycle Company (also called 102 Bicycle Shop)

<BR>
You should call first to ensure that they have what you want. Call a day
or two in advance so they can get what you want, especially if you will
be staying only a short time in Taipei.

The differences between British and Taiwanese are "quality of components".
Most of the components are made in Taiwan and cheap (no no, are reasonable).
But the Sturmey Archer shifter is assembled.
And we cannot use the optional "Front carrier block".
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Paul Collins, Dec 1997:</EM><BR>
I have recently purchased a Brompton here in Hong Kong, actually
only two weeks ago.  It is of the Taiwanese assembly and so far so
good except ....
<BR>
The rubber suspension stopper has all but disintegrated after only
using it only about 5 times and has basically fallen off !!  I
would not say that I am overweight at 6'1" weighing 85 Kgs (don't
know what that is in pounds).  I have only ridden on paved roads
and concrete footpaths (not off-road).
<BR>
The dealer I purchased from is quite reputable so should have no
trouble getting a replacement of this.  However, I would not like
to think this is going to be a recurring problem.
<BR>
Is this an experienced problem with a better solution than the
standard rubber stopper ???
<BR>
On another issue, the standard brakes are rather poor.  After
leaving my mountain bike (which as excellent stopping power) this
bike would take at least 2-3 times further to stop at similar
speed.  Is it just a matter of changing to quality brake pads (and
longer) or it an issue with the antiquated side-pull brakes ??
Otherwise, is this unresolvable being related to the dynamics of
16" rims ???
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Steven M. Scharf, Feb 1998:</EM><BR>
On the Taiwanese Brompton the fender is held by an L bracket on
the bolt that holds the rear brake, and by a plastic clip that goes around
the rear of the rear rack. I think it is completely different than the UK
Brompton.
<BR>
With or without rubbing, the fender interfered with proper
operation of the rear brake. I am going to trim the fender
plastic so it doesn't interfere with the brake, then see if
it still rubs. Or I may just put a splash guard on the rear rack
(I guess your L5 doesn't have a rear rack, but the Taiwanese
L3 does), and see if that works in place of a fender.
<BR>
No doubt the Taiwanese Brompton is lower quality. The components
are all probably bottom of the line. It's difficult to tell about the frame
quality--it looks fine, but who knows what kind of steel they are using.
For my use I could not justify spending $850 or so, but at $240 it became
attractive even if I have to replace some components. If the frame breaks
then it's a different story. I only know one other person with a Taiwanese
model, and he said it was fine, but this was several years ago and I
have lost contact with him.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Steven M. Scharf, Feb 1998:</EM><BR>
I believe the real problem I'm having is that the fender simply does not
properly fit under the brake; the rear brake didn't work properly until I
removed the fender. I need to trim a bit of the plastic away so
the fender can sit higher and not interfere with the brake or hit the tire.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Custfold, Feb 1998:</EM><BR>
The original and if I recall correctly Taiwan Bromptons use a 1" headseat
and correspondingly small steerer tube.
This was considered too small & flexible in the light of
service experience.  Whilst the forces on a 'bent bars are likely to be
smaller, as you can't honk up a hill, there may have been some apprehension on
modifying the steerer to give potentially greater leverage on the headset and
joints.  Brompton are very thorough in testing the components to learn of
expected fatigue life, and can usually tell you where the component
will fail when overloaded - I usually prove them right....
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Arnold in Vancouver, BC Canada, Apr 98:</EM><BR>
Funny I bought two of them in the "west". I think you just have to be
prepared to search them out.
<BR>
Also, I hate it when people say the Neobike's parts are lower quality I
think the quality is extremely light at this price point. All I changed
was the brake pads and hand grips.

Brompton patents have proven defensible right
across the world, although - as is well known in the industry - the
patents do not have long to run. [...]
<BR>
The [Brompton] company probably rather regret the licensing agreement
with Neobike
as the Taiwanese company have not always been entirely honest and are not
too scrupulous about paying Royalties. The Neobike machines are strictly
NOT for sale in Europe, North America and Australia, but odd ones or twos
have found their way in.
Components are not all bad, and one or two are now fitted to new
Bromptons, but the Neobike does not have the braze-on for the front
carrier system - a major disadvantage. There's also some question marks
over the engineering quality. All-in-all, I'm happy to have bought a
Brompton, but I can see how the price of the Taiwanese bike must look
tempting.

Disclaimer: This is not an official response, as I am not affiliated with

<BR>
The Neobike frames are made by that company in Taiwan. They are "genuine"
Bromptons in that they are made under license, but they are not identical to
the British frames. The construction and finish is somewhat cruder than the
British-made Bromptons, e.g. the top tube appears to be bent without a
mandrel, which causes some distortion and wrinkling on the underside of the
tube. I have also heard that the metallurgy of frame materials is less
consistent than the British product.
The Neobike Brompton weight is comparable
to a similarly-equipped English-made Brompton from several years ago, which
probably means the Neobike is heavier than the latest generation of British-
made bikes.
The component and accessory differences have already been noted on
this list. Lastly, the Brompton licensing agreement for Neobike does not
extend to North America.
Some people may bring "pirated" Taiwan-made Bromptons
into the States, but don't expect to be covered by the factory warranty.

I have a Taiwanese one and I seem to suffer the same problems as
people have with the UK ones, no more or less. It's still rather new
though.
<BR>
The components on the Taiwanese ones seem to be lower grade, i.e.
the hubs and brakes. The headset is smaller diameter. There is no
provision for the very cool Brompton front pannier (though people have
been able to fit it by improvising). These were observations by UK
Brompton owners on the last SF folder ride. I did hear once that the
frame material was not as good on the Taiwanese models, but I have
no evidence that this is true.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Steven M. Scharf, Jul 1998:</EM><BR>
I have the Taiwanese made version of the Brompton, called the L3-T
(it has the rear rack but no lights). It also comes with a nylon carrying
bag, folding pedal, and pump. In Taiwan it was US$235.
<BR>
Overall I've been satisfied but there have been a couple of problems:
<BR>
1) The rear fender interferes with the operation of the rear brake. I tried
for hours to adjust everything, but finally gave up and removed the fender.
<BR>
2) I noticed last week (after owning it for five months) that the right
pedal
was cross threaded into the crank arm. I had to order a set of Park pedal
taps (pedal threads are 9/16" x 20 tpi, not something a hardware store
has) to fix this.
<BR>
For a level ride the Brompton is fine. They're a little scary on hills
because the brakes are poor, but this is a problem on the British
ones too, and you learn to compensate. There has been a lot of
discussion of remedies to this problem but I haven't done any of them yet.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Ian R. Platt, Oct 1998:</EM><BR>
Made under license by Neobike.  This is a bit of a hybrid: it has 3
gears, no lights, but does have a rear carrier frame (a heavy-duty
wire job - not as nice as the UK version).  More crucially, they do
<EM>not</EM> have the holes in the stearing tube for the front carrier
block.  It may still be possible to fix this with a jubilee clip or
some such - I think this was mentioned in a post a while back - but
such an arrangement may not be as solid as the UK version.  The
Taiwan model has a pump, and it comes with a folding left pedal.  It
comes in more colours too!  I've seen yellow, red, blue, a lovely
racing green, and they have more union flag stickers on them than the
UK version!
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Ian R. Platt, Nov 1998:</EM><BR>
[...] the Neobikes come with a lovely
shoulder bag-type bag in the standard Ford range of colour.  The bike

My Taiwan Brompton cost about $NT7000 earlier this year.
<BR>
The best way for your girlfriend to find a shop is to telephone NEOBIKE
and ask them for the name of a reseller in her area.  I think NEOBIKE will
refer her first to the local distributor. My friends made a couple of phone
calls for
me when I was there.  They gave me written instructions for a taxi to take
me
to the shop.  Great entertainment in the bike shop as we mutually gestured
about
bike, colour, accessories, etc.  Thankfully the owners grandson was present
to
speak a little school learnt English.  Ah the joys of being an ugly western
traveller
with no local language.
<BR>
FWIW, The Taiwan Brompton is 3speed with rear carrier (but no front block) &
comes with a
carry bag and a seat bag to take the folded carry bag.  I had a little
problem with quality,
so I suggest you get your girlfriend to take the bike out of the cardboard
box and ride a little
before she leaves the shop - listening for rattles, rubbing, stiffness, etc.
<BR>
The best entertainment was with the Hilton hotel door staff.  They were all
impressed
by the bike, that it was Taiwanese made and wanted to know the cost.  Never
a
problem to fold it and take it up to my room.  Drivers in Tapei still expect
to see cycles and
Motor cycles, so I neve had any trouble with them - even when riding late at
night.
<BR>
My Brompton came from a little shop down near the river in Tapei.  However,
I first saw them in the sports department of the AsiaWorld department
store right opposite the main train station & MRT station where they were
on sale for about $NT8500.

I have had a Neobike Brompton for over four years, in fact I've have two.
One is in England (my home) and the other is in Hong Kong where I work for
most of the year.
<BR>
Both are in black, with three-speed Sturmey Archer hub hears, rear rack
fitted, mudguards, folding left-hand pedal included and were a lot cheaper
to buy than in England. Though I've seen mention of build quality problems,
I've never had a problem with either of them. The one in Hong Kong gets the
most use, and I've seen quite a few other people using them. One odd thing
is that in Hong Kong, it's virtually immpossible to get spare tyres! The
only 16 inch ones are the smaller, fatter type usually seen on Asian built
bikes like Dahon, etc. Anyway, it's no problem in the UK and I get
replacements from there when needed.
<BR>
There are quite a few shops selling Neobike Bromptons, and the price varies
depending on the location of the shop, the nationality of the person asking
the price, and whether you look like you are a tourist or living here. The
place in Hong Kong where I got my two bikes say they can send them if
necessary.
<BR>
The price last Saturday (when I asked) is HK$3800 each including the freight
charge and insurance to England. Usually for payment from overseas you need
to go to a bank and buy a draft which you send to the shop.
<BR>
The person to contact is Wong Lai Mui on fax 852  (for Hong Kong) then 2625
4030 or you can email me direct and I will ask any questions you have.
<BR>
By the way, I did try direct from Taiwan, before buying my second Brompton.
However the hassles were just to much. Hardly anyone spoke English there,
and no one really wanted to send out one-off orders. However I guess the
prices would be cheaper, if you can do it!
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Steven M. Scharf, Feb 2000:</EM><BR>
First of all, there are no Bromptons made in China.
Neobike makes Bromptons under license in Taiwan. They
have one model, the L3A which is better than the UK
Brompton, at least in terms of components, and one model
the L3B which is not as good as the UK Brompton. The brakes
on the L3B stop just as poorly as the brakes on the UK Bromptons,
on the L3A there are V-Brakes.
<BR>
See:

<BR>
I don't know if the L3A is actually in production
as the bike shop in Taipei that carries Bromptons
said that they couldn't get them.
<BR>
I have two of the L3Bs, the last one I purchased
in Taiwan in January 2000 for about $255 with left
folding pedal and carrying bag. The first one was a
little less due to the currency exchange rates. These
have been fine so far.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Stephen Casey, Feb 2000:</EM><BR>
I'm an owner of both the English T3
and the Taiwanese (actually I have two) L3B (it is more a T3 like
version-since it has the touring rack).  And I live in SF.  You are
welcome to look at the two side by side and "kick the tires" so to
speak.  I've been using the one Neobike regularly with the CalTrain
between Hillsdale/San Mateo and Potrero Hill.  Let's face it, there are
some pretty awful design flaws and I could go on about those-most
notably the brakes.  Probably a little inferior manufacturing, but the
English one is not that much better.  The english version is based on a
good idea-which by the way the taiwanese version is identical here-but
that's about it.  There is not much technical superiority of the english
version over the taiwanese version, anyone who tells you otherwise is
fooling everyone.  Both could be a lot better for certain, but let's not
kid ourselvelves that one is FAR superior to the other-they both could
stand many technical advancements.

Oops . . . I've said too much.  Sorry, I get a little peeved when people
start aluding that the english Brompton is some sort of standard for
excellence in folding bike-speak.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Steven M. Scharf, Feb 2000:</EM><BR>
I agree with all of this. The Neobike is only slightly inferior to the UK
made unit. Neither is
made with wonderful components. However with the UK model you get a lot of
expertise from
Channell in terms of upgrades of stuff like brakes and gearing, both of
which are not
very good for this area the way the bike comes from the factory. Also the
Neobike
doesn't support the front luggage system.
<BR>
There are many superior folding bikes in terms of components, durability,
and ridability, such as the Montague, the Gaerlan, and even some of
the Dahons, but these others don't fold as small or as fast as the
Brompton, which after all is what attracts people to the Brompton
in the first place.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Andras Toth, Feb 2000:</EM><BR>
You might be interested to hear what happened when, reading the ongoing
discussion about Neobikes I sent a buyer enquiry to them via Internet out
of pure curiosity. Since I am in France for six months I indicated my
postal address here.
Actually, Neobike forwarded my request to Brompton UK, who answered that
Neobike are only entitled to sell their products in the Far East.

I have had two of the Taiwan built Bromptons,
and have used them for years, one in Hong Kong, the other in the UK (I
commute between the two places on a regular basis). No problems, the gearing
is Sturmy Archer from the UK, the back carrier is better, the extras that
cost more on the UK model, are standard fitting on the Taiwan model. There
is even a wide choice of colours available, immediately from stock. Okay,
there is not provision for the front carrier/bag, but with a price of less
than half the UK model, I can handle that. Many quality bicycles are made in
Taiwan, as are most components, it's just a fact that's not shouted out
loudly by sales assistants. On an organised Brompton ride in south London
last year, most other Bromtoneers couldn't see any real difference.
<BR>
Finally, talking about prices. It seems to me that Bromptons, and indeed
many other products in the west, and especially overpriced. Whether it is
the intention of the manufacturer and/or supplier. Perhaps it's taxes
applied by governments. But whatever it is, it seems that the consumer, that
is you and I are the ones who suffer. The rate of pay for a factory worker
in Taiwan is about the same as that of one in the UK. Certainly they don't
pay as much in income tax, other taxes are less too. Even so, they have the
(Taiwanese) Bromton for sale on the streets at around US$250, it was more
before, but exchange rates have changed somewhat quite recently.
<BR>
And one more finally! Talking about development. I would say Neobike have
done their fair share of that. Was it not them that developed the
light-weight aluminium Brompton that was on show in Japan a year ago?

<H2><A NAME="37"></A>Is there some advantage over getting direct from UK vs from Channell in California?</H2>
<UL>
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Jerry Kaidor, Aug 1999:</EM><BR>
Just price.  The things are cheaper in the UK.  Also, I effectively
got free shipping, because I had a checked baggage right to spare.  And,
since I didn't buy much else on that trip, I got them home duty-free!
I even got the VAT returned, since I took them out of Europe.
<BR>
Whereas Channell has to pay for shipping and duty.  Then he needs to
take some profit on his shipping and duty.  And charge me sales tax on
top of that!  This is offset to some extant by his being local and
being able to supply warrantee service.  If my Bromptons die, I'll
need to ship them back to the U.K.
<BR>
The second "advantage" was purely personal and psychological.  My wife
had dragged me along on this monumentally boring transatlantic cruise.
A empty three-week hole had been carved out of my life.  Surely there was
something interesting and useful I could accomplish during the cruise?

However, looking as his prices and the
prices listed on the UK Brompton site they are nearly identical?

<H2><A NAME="39"></A>Where can I find a second hand Brompton?</H2>
The longest list of second hand Brompton appears in <A HREF="#A2B">A to B Magazine</A>.
<UL>
<LI><EM CLASS="from">David Henshaw, Apr 98:</EM><BR>
Generally, Bromptons are
quite rare second-hand, and there's little point in buying one
anyway. The second-hand price tends to mirror the new price without
adjustment for inflation. If you paid &pound;300 a few years ago, you
will get &pound;300 now. If you pay &pound;500 today, you'll get &pound;500 in a
few years, etc. Good if you're selling, but bad news if you are
buying - the new bikes are much lighter than even last year's
examples.
Having said that, I met someone recently who found two new Bromptons
in the local free-paper for &pound;350 the pair. A real bargain. When he
arrived, the phone was ringing continuously.
<BR>
Then there's the (true) story of the boss who bought one for his
plane, but didn't like it, so asked his secretary to sell it. She put
the brand-new bike in the local paper for &pound;25...
<BR>
Just a personal view - don't waste &pound;500 on a 'T' type. Go for the
cheapest, lightest bike... a &pound;390 L3, but add the front carrier
block, and buy some luggage and Primo tyres when you can afford it.
You will love you L3 much more, and it'll keep its value better than
a 'T'.

<H2><A NAME="40"></A>How do I inspect a second-hand Brompton?</H2>
<EM CLASS="from">Pierre-Philippe Coupard, Oct 2003:</EM><BR>
On top of my hear, look for these:
<UL>
<LI>"Crunchy" noise of feeling in the rear hub, or gears that don't engage
or disengage right.
<LI>slack rear triangle hinge : lift the saddle slightly so the rear
triangle's rubber block doesn't touch the frame, and push the bottom of
the saddle post sideways back and forth : you may feel something moving
slightly, but if you can see the rear triangle and the main frame
"bending" with your naked eye, that's bad.
<LI>Paint that lifts around a weld.
<LI>Hinge plates (the U-shaped aluminium thingies that hold the bike
together) bottoming out on the frame
<LI>Rust on the inside face of the hinges.
<LI>Worn/damaged saddle post clamp : the post should be locked with a
reasonable amount of force to the clamp. If you have to push like crazy,
that may not be right. Also check for lifting paint and/or rust in the area.
<LI>Bad BB or failing chainring : make sure you don't hear or feel any
clicking noise that follows the pedalling rythm when you pedal. If you
do hear something, try to pedal harder on one pedal, then the next, to
see if it doesn't come from the folding pedal.
<LI>Worn chainring/chain/sprocket : push the chain outward on the
chainring, where it's fully engaged : if the chain moves and you can see
between the chain and the teeth, you might have to change the chainring
and the chain.
<LI>Worn front hub : lift the front wheel, spin it by hand, and try to
listen to something crunchy, or feel an uneven resistance. Also see if
there's play when you rock the edge of the wheel back and forth.
<LI>Worn folding pedal : pedal on the bike and check that it doesn't feel
out of true under your left foot. Check using both sides of the platform.
<LI>Damage to the rim walls
<LI>Worn tires : not a problem in itself, but if the owner claims to use
the bike only seldom and the tires are bare to the thread, beware. Also
watch for bald patches on the rear tires, that might indicate the guy
has a habit of locking the rear wheel to brake, which in turn may
indicates abuse to the bike.
<LI>Slack brake levers : if you rock the brake levers back and forth,
there should be a little play, but excessive play, or significantly more
play on one lever than the other may indicate the owner crashed (and the
bike landed on one lever).
<LI>General condition of the bike : if the brakes aren't well adjusted, if
the pain is in good condition, if the chain looks like it hasn't seen
lubrication in a long time, if there's crud accumulating where it's not
too easy to clean ... A clean and well adjusted bike means a careful owner.
