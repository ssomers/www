<EM CLASS="from">Chris Eacock:</EM><P>
Due to heavy rains, the snow in the San
Joaquin River watershed has been melting faster than
usual, filling up reservoirs and flooding many areas of
central California.  I am on the emergency crew working
12 hour shifts at Friant Dam.  This dam is about a mile
wide, with three drum gates in the middle that regulate
flood water.  The drum gates are very simple in design
because they use buoyancy to hold back water, thus do
not need electricity to run, but the valves must be
controlled by hand.
<P>
Each hour, it is customary to drive a truck backwards
across to the middle of the dam to the block-house above
the valves.  Imagine doing that in the rain, when its dark,
and with a rising reservoir beside you!
<P>
On my shift (January 3, 1997), I drove to the side of the
dam, took out my Brompton, rode out to the middle,
tweaked the valve, and rode back in less time than was
customary.

<EM CLASS="from">Bruce Boysen:</EM><P>
Here is a typical errand/shopping run on my Brompton, which is what I did
today. I hopped on Gumby (this is what my kids promptly named my Brompton
upon seeing it fold) in my regular shoes & clothes & headed for the store a
few miles away, passing someone on a nice Trek road bike, which I thought was
a hoot. (with its very upright position the Brompton is not exactly fast)
Grabbed a shopping cart, folded my bike, put it in the cart & went in the
store. No worries about anyone messing with this bike. Bought a full bag of
food, unfolded the bike & clipped on the basket while several women stopped
to say nice things. When I was thinking about getting this bike someone wrote
that its a babe magnet, I didn't believe him at the time but its true, women
are fascinated & excited by this bike! Guys, put a puppy in the basket &
women would literally chase you down the road in a frenzy, overcome by the
combined cuteness.


<H2><A NAME="281"></A>All is well that ends well...</H2>
<EM CLASS="from">Channell Wasson:</EM><P>
Today I hooked up my trailer and had a great ride to the UPS terminal to
send off a suitcase order.
My [Bykaboose] trailer holds a Brompton box with ample room left over,
and it tows beautifully.
I made my delivery at UPS and worked my way back through
streets of a mixed bayside neighborhood near our house.  I came up short
at a cul de sac where ten little kids were playing.  They loved the
Brompton and each one wanted a ride in the trailer.  I obliged them all!
There was much running along side, laughing and shouting.  One boy
relaxed by sitting back with his feet in the air while he composed a
poem or two.  That was a nice time!  A trail led out of the cul de sac
and I followed it through the bay marshland for some four miles 'til I
came to a road that took me home. I've worked up a good apetite!


<H2><A NAME="282"></A>More trailer</H2>
<EM CLASS="from">Channell Wasson, Feb 1998:</EM><P>
We are having big floods just now in my neighborhood.  My side of the
street was ok last night, but at two AM yesterday scores of houses all
around me were inundated with mud and water when the creek that runs
through our town overflowed. Tonight and over the next two days bigger
storms are coming.  The City Fathers have provided free sand and sand
bags.  Today I hauled 51 sand bags at 40 plus pounds each (4-6 at a
time) behind my brompton in my Bykaboose trailler. What a great concept
is the totally simple Bykaboose from China (not Taiwan). We have stacked
the sand bags around our house, and now we hope for the best.   If Dave
Holiday (Mr. think big and heavy when inovating) had still been here we
could have hauled 20 bags at a time! Dave came to see me in California
last week and we had coffee and cake and a great time bragging about
folding and Bromptons, his consuming passion.


<H2><A NAME="PMLcatastrophy"></A>Catastrophic failure of Brompton in traffic</H2>
{PML - full name hidden, since I didn't obtain his or her permission
to make this delicate case more public}<P>
BACKGROUND. I brought my Brompton with me to Australia from the U.K. in 1989,
and for just over two years I used it for regular commuting on roads and bike
paths, only ever taking it outside Melbourne once, when I rode on a metalled
country road between a station and an airshow. I had many different component
failures, e.g. broken spokes, brake and gear cables, the folding pedal, and
the dynamo fell off. Worst of all, as I had to have replacements flown in from
the U.K., the rear wheel sprockets broke repeatedly. On each occasion he sent
me new sprockets Andrew Ritchie asserted, usually incorrectly, that these
would not fail again. When they were finally of good workmanship they did not
fit the chain, so that also needed to be replaced. This attitude told me that
Andrew Ritchie was over-optimistic, but I was able to live with these repeated
minor failures.
<P>
MAIN ACCIDENT. At about 8.20 a.m. on the 29th of January, 1992, while starting
into motion at traffic lights, the steering column literally came apart in my
hands without warning. I do not mean it came unfastened - the metal split
through.
<P>
BEHAVIOUR OF LOCAL BROMPTON AGENT. Once I found out who to contact, I left
messages on his answerphone. He did not reply to these, but immediately went
to see the Brompton at the shop and contacted Andrew Ritchie to set things in
motion - but without knowing anything at all about the accident. He guessed -
wrongly - that I wanted a replacement part. Actually, I wanted tests done.
After all, most Brompton replacements had been defective, and until I knew
what caused the failure I didn't want a repair that just created another
deathtrap. After the agent started all this he telephoned me, and I asked him
to hold off until we could meet and sort details out. Instead, when a
replacement part arrived he went into the bicycle shop and countermanded my
instructions to hold all work until we knew what to do. Then, and only then,
he read the letter I had sent him. When I contacted him next he refused to
meet me, and took the view he had been extremely helpful. But it's like the
old joke about the four boy scouts who helped the little old lady across the
road - it took that many because she didn't want to go. I was faced with
paying costs and labour for a repair I didn't want and which I had reason to
believe was dangerous. I ordered the unwanted and probably dangerous
replacement removed, but I couldn't get the bicycle back while the shop were
out of pocket from paying the agent.
<P>
ATTITUDE OF ANDREW RITCHIE [inventor of the Brompton]. About this time I got in touch with Andrew
Ritchie, by expensive international telephone calls and by post. I tried to
get him to conduct tests. He assured me that the replacement would not fail,
but he did not seem to get the point. There were two problems. He had
sincerely thought replacement sprockets would not fail, and he was wrong. He
did not appear to understand that the other Brompton riders might be at risk
unless this was an isolated freak accident. I wanted him to test all this
properly, and issue warnings if necessary. He took the view that the existing
static test was good enough (but I already knew he was over-optimistic), and
he had to be nudged to make his agent reimburse the bicycle shop for the money
that he had improperly taken from them. Then I was able to send the old,
broken part to London for examination - which also cost me a lot of money. I
also paid for photographs to be taken. I went to a lot of trouble to let
Andrew Ritchie make tests, but in the end, if he did, he never told me. He did
return the part so one day I can get a proper repair made from it. I tried to
warn Andrew Ritchie what could happen. I told him that if anyone got killed or
hurt in a similar accident he wouldn't be able to declare that it was
unforeseeable, because he already knew about this. I also told him that if he
didn't keep his insurance company fully informed, both about this accident and
about any tests he conducted, his insurance coverage was likely to be void -
for any coverage, not just similar accidents. I tried to make it quite clear
that I was not threatening him, because these things would happen whatever I
did. But I did tell him that I would keep the public as fully informed as I
possibly could, because I thought it was in the public interest. He took the
view that I was threatening him, and I took - and still take - the view that
he didn't seem to be taking this seriously. He found that offensive. I found
it offensive when Andrew Ritchie said I had not faced a serious threat to my
life, and when he said the agent must have agreed things with me when he
overrode my instructions not to make a repair. The agent ought to have done,
but he never did, and Andrew Ritchie simply refused to believe it - I have
never even met the agent. So there was a failure of communication causing bad
feeling on all sides, but at least I was trying to get in touch.
<P>
RESULTS SINCE. Andrew Ritchie hung up the telephone, and if he ever did
anything in the way of tests, informing his insurers or informing the Brompton
riding public I never heard anything about it. A responsible manufacturer
would have done, or something else equally responsible, and as I am sure
Brompton are responsible I am sure my not being informed what happened next is
a simple oversight. But I do feel a personal responsibility to tell the public
what happened to me, as I might be the only one who knows this part of the
whole story.

<EM CLASS="from">Vanna Campbell:</EM><P>
The same guards that used to hassle me about my old bike,
to the point where I went through major channels just to be able to park it
*near* where I work, don't even seem to know the Brompton is a bike (in its
bag), and I sail right past, day after day.  Of course, I don't let them see
me fold it up, and I hide it under my desk ("Bike?  Sure, look around.  I
don't think you'll find any bikes here!"  -- and they don't *find* any bikes
at all).


<H2><A NAME="SAvi5"></A>Savi's SA-5 saga</H2>
<EM CLASS="from">Savi Maharaj:</EM><P>
I bought a brand new T5
in January on which I've done only about 300 miles.  I've had
recurrent problems with the hub.  After just a few days of ownership,
I found that the gears kept coming out of adjustment.  Finally, the
wee chain thing (what is it really called?) on the gear mechanism
broke, so I took the bike back to the shop.  They told me that I'd
probably caused it to break by over-tightening the adjusting screw
(hmmm.....) but they repaired it for me so I was happy.  For about a
week.  Then (yesterday) the gears quite suddenly became unadjusted
again, and I noticed that the little chain is no longer aligned with
the metal groove in which it sits.  It's rubbing against the edges of
this groove, and I'm sure it'll eventually break again if nothing is
done.  So my bike is back in the shop.
<P>
I got my bike back from the shop today.  It's in working order again.
As I understand it, the mechanic's theory about the source of the
problem is this: On my bike, the indicator chain rests within a metal
groove which appears to act as a guide.  (I'm told that older 5-speed
hubs don't have this feature.)  Apparently, there was a loose nut
somewhere inside the housing where this metal guide is attached to the
rest of the gear mechanism.  This caused the guide to drift out of
alignment with the chain, which then rubbed against the edges of the
guide and eventually broke.  The mechanic tightened the offending nut --
we'll see if that solves the problem.

<EM CLASS="from">Aug 1997:</EM><P>
Following the final adjustment mentioned
in the story, I've had no more problems with my gears.


<H2><A NAME="284"></A>The Kaidor Cruise</H2>
<EM CLASS="from">Jerry Kaidor, Sep 1997:</EM><P>
Hello!
<P>
I just got back home to California last night from a transatlantic cruise.
And am happy to say that there is now a pair of Bromptons - an L3 and an L5 -
sitting in my living room!
<P>
It took careful planning.  We'd signed up for the cruise back in
April, and I got the Brompton idea in June.  I needed a couple of folding
bycicles to fit in my airplane.  I'd tried out the commonly available Dahons
and hadn't liked them - like riding a circus act.  Wobble-wobble down the
road.  Don't let go of the handlebars!  Guess all tiny-wheel bicyles are
like that, right?  Wrong....
<P>
I was sitting in the dentist's chair, having my teeth cleaned.  Dentist
a big bicycle nut.
<P>
Me:  "Glurgle-spit-I'm looking for a folding bicycle"<BR>
Dentist: "Hey, I've got a folding bicycle.  And it's for sale!"
<P>
...So I acquired my Moulton Stowaway.  What a revelation!  It rode just
like a real bike!  But it was only one speed, and really, it just *barely*
fit in the airplane's boot.  Wouldn't take too many outings to trash the
airplane upholstery.  Have you ever shopped for airplane upholstery?
Better not, if you value your wallet.  Something more was needed.
<P>
The Internet yielded up websites full of folding bike information.
A few interesting candidates.  DiBlasi makes a sturdy little fellow
that folds up in parallelograms - but it's 35 pounds ( weight ), and
not available in the USA.
<P>
Then I found the Brompton.  Wow... According to the specs, these
things would fold up small enough for TWO of them to fit in the boot.
I joined this list.   The combination of web information and list
correspondence convinced me.   Say, aren't we going to stop in England
on this cruise?  Yup, there's a day in Southampton.  Wonder if there's
a Brompton stockist?
<P>
Tony Clarke called up Brompton and found me two Southampton shops.
( Tony, I promise - really - I'll look up that information I promised
you! )  I called long distance; called back the next day - did a little
credit card magic - and had a confirmed order for an L3 and an L5,
each with folding pedal, and two stowage sacks. And none too soon.
<P>
Fast forward to a week ago:  Apparently, Bromptons are made slowly
and lovingly, there in Chiswick Park.  I called the shop from Halifax,
Nova Scotia, the first stop with some free time.
<P>
"Brompton assure me that they'll be here on the 30th".
( Meaning they weren't there yet )
<P>
After a long and boring ocean crossing, we steamed into Southampton.
After some minor adventures with getting money changed ( it was a Saturday
),  we called the shop and took a taxi ride up there.  The bikes were there,
I rode one around the block, put it back in its packing box, and paid the man.
<P>
Here's where we had the real adventure of the trip:  my wife had wanted
to rent a car.  Down at the port, all the rental agencies were swamped with
people from our ship ( the Norway; second largest cruise ship in the
world ).   I thought I'd gotten away with it.  But the bicycle shop owner
knew of a rental place up in his area.  Untouched by the Norway flood,
they had cars.  Rats!  He rode us down to the rental office, where we
stuffed ourselves and the Bromptons into a Ford "KA".
<P>
Anybody remember "The Wind in the Willows"?  Mr Toad's Wild Ride?
Suffice to say that the combination of driving on the wrong side of the
road, the narrow streets, and the heavy traffic, was just too much.  Bet
my hair comes through white.  Hope they don't charge too dear for that
hubcap!
<P>
I had thought to take the bikes back home as carry-ons, but after
seeing them, decided that it would be better to tape and rope the two boxes
together, and make them a single checked baggage.  That's what I did, and
they made it through in fine style.
<P>
I just rode the L5 around the block.  Haven't even unpacked the luggage
yet - gotta keep priorities, you know :-).  Handling - good.  Seems geared
a bit low, but my home neighborhood is flat as a pancake.  Is it normal
for them to go "tick-tick-tick" when you pedal forward?  Or does it mean
that the gearchange needs adjustment?  Brakes are extremely effective,
almost like a car.  Guess that's because of the alloy rims.

<EM CLASS="from">Jerry Kaidor, Nov 1997:</EM><P>
Greetings,
<P>
Yesterday, I flew to work....
<P>
Stuffed the L5 into the airplane, pulled it out at San Jose
International airport, and cycled to work through Silicon Valley.  It
was about 4 miles.  Man, am I out of shape!
[...]
<P>
I'd known that I'd need to come back in the dark, and had dropped by
a bicycle shop to get some night lighting.  Bicycle lights sure have
come a long way since my youth!  I bought a self-contained "Cateye HL500"
for the front, and a doodad with five  LEDs to clip to my belt.
Wound up using the HL500 to preflight the plane, and the LED thingie to
see inside the cockpit. :-)


<H2><A NAME="286"></A>The world's most southerly Brompton...</H2>

<DIV ALIGN=right>South Pole Station (U.S.)

</DIV>
Brompton Aficionados,
<P>
This evening I have placed our real-time web camera looking out the window
of the Australian AASTO observatory, and have pointed it towards various
other astronomical observatories located here at the South Geographic Pole.
The WWW address of our real-time webcam is: [deleted :)]
<P>
Sky conditions are currently heavily overcast, with falling 'diamond dust'
snow, and the picture quality is not good and of low contrast.  Even so, you
will make out a familiar sight in the picture.  I have been using the
Brompton to cycle between the Dark Sector* and the main Dome building here
at Pole.  Pedestrians have pounded decent hard tracks in the snow which are
quite suitable to ride on even with small narrow wheels.  The snow here is
very dry, 'sugar snow' as it's sometimes called.  It's not particularly good
for snowballs but the snow surface soon pounds down to a concrete hardness.
<P>
Today is actually the anniversary of Scott's arrival at the Pole.  I wonder
what he would have exclaimed if he'd found a Brompton rather than Amundsen's
tent!  If the weather was like today (as it's been for the last few weeks)
then it would have added to Scott's miseries.  It hasn't been a great season
for astronomy or Bromptons, which don't take well to being ridden through
fresh snowdrifts.  This particular cold-o-holic Brompton (#5094) has already
survived three winters in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada, a place
[in]famous for its snow and cold.  In 1995 it wintered at the most southerly
British Antarctic Base of Halley, located on the Brunt Ice Shelf (75S 24W).
<P>
We have just set up this real-time webcam, the first ever at the Pole we
believe.  But we have to be thoughtful with its use because of the limited
amount of satellite-link bandwidth available.  As a courtesy to the local
users, if you do log into the webcam, please do not place the camera into
'server push' mode, where it continually streams images.  Likewise, please
do not broadcast or place this webcam address on any other servers or
newsgroups; it's strictly for Brompton-talkers to enjoy!  If we note our
camera is getting too many hits we'll have to restrict access.
<P>
Time to trudge back to the Dome*.  What!... not riding you say?  Nope...  an
hour or so ago I noticed a flat front tyre.  Although I haven't checked it I
suspect something split in the -30's temperatures of the last couple of
days.  I'll fix it tomorrow... Scott never had to endure such things! (* to
escape the worst winter cold, which dips into the -70's C, the main
buildings are located inside a giant aluminium geodesic dome, know simply as
'The Dome').
<P>

<H2><A NAME="287"></A>Love at first sight</H2>
<EM CLASS="from">Freeman Ng, May 1998:</EM><P>
I just saw (and rode) a Brompton for the first time today, and boy, am I
excited!  (I went over to Channell Wasson's place to see them.  He was just
back from the Los Angeles bike show and VERY tired, but was nice enough to
spend quite a bit of time showing me everything.)  Even after reading all
the website material and being on this mailing list, I wasn't quite
prepared for the reality.
<P>
First of all, I somehow didn't expect it to be so *substantial*.  I guess I
had a subconscious expectation that it would be, oh, I don't know...
spindly? rickety?  I mean, after all, it's a folding bike, the rear half of
which swings loose!  But I was quite impressed by how solid the bike is,
and by how securely it folds up.  Beyond that, though, there was a real
presence to the thing.  Perhaps it was just the novelty of its being a
folding bike (I've never seen any folding bike up close before) but for
whatever reason, it had a real magnetic effect on me.
<P>
Then I was surprised at how nice the ride was.  The smaller tires took
about 30 seconds to get used to, and after that, it was like riding any
normal bike, except that it might even have been more magical.  To me,
there is something about riding a bike (especially when you have "no
particular place to go") that's almost like flying, and the effect seemed
to be enhanced because there was so much less bike to be conscious of.
<P>
Finally, I still can't get over how clever the engineering is.  Not just
how easily it folds and how small it folds, but how the different parts of
the bike all work together to keep it securely folded, and how everything
(chains, rack, etc.) is made to fit in the limited space available, folded
and otherwise.
<P>
I was already planning on buying one this summer, but boy, am I tempted to
go right back to Channell's tomorrow and take one home now!

<EM CLASS="from">Liduine Reuser, Jun 1998:</EM><P>
Hello,
<P>
I'm new on this list, let me introduce myself.
(by the way, excuse me for my english, since english is not my mother language)
<P>
I am a happy Bromptonner (T3) since 2 months.
When I accepted my new job, I asked for a free public transport card + Brompton, in stead of a lease car
(which caused a lot of stress in my last job...)
They accepted, and since that time I'm very happy with my new job
and this very comfortable means of transport.
I never get tired of demonstrating the easy (un)folding, the easy riding, the easy carrying...
And there are a lot of people at railway station or just on the street, who look and ask...)
My enthousiasm is so big that I call myself now sometimes 'Tony Brom' at the chat-channel
where I'm frequently on. This enthousiasm is partly caused by the fact
that I don't need a car anymore, and therefore I feel good again.
And partly because my Tony Brom is marvellous ! The day after I bought it,
I had an interview in Utrecht, 40 km away from where I live near Amsterdam.
I decided that morning to go by Brompton in stead of by train.
The next weekend, Tony and I cycled around the province of 'Zeeland' in the South-West of Holland.
150 km in 1 1/2 day on a Brompton, it's as good as my Giant !!!

<EM CLASS="from">John Blackburn, Aug 1998:</EM><P>
It's been a difficult 3 months. But my Brompton helped a lot.
On 8th May at 7am my wife said she felt unwell, and then she collapsed,
and then she couldn't speak any more. I called an ambulance, which came
in 3 minutes, and it took her to Lewisham A & E in South London. They
diagnosed a cerebral haemorrhage (a type of stroke), and sent her to
Kings Hospital in Denmark Hill, Camberwell (4 miles away). Here, a
3-hour brain operation was carried out. It was completely successful and
she is now home and well on the way to a complete recovery.
<P>
So where does the Brompton come in?
Camberwell isn't designed for the car. There is no parking near the
hospital. It is congested. It is 6.4 miles from where I live and the car
journey takes a very long time and my fuel consumption is halved.
<P>
So it's ideal for a bike. I took my Raleigh road bike and locked it up
outside the hospital, but at least one good citizen of Camberwell is a
bit light-fingered and I found somebody had tampered with the lock.
<P>
So I used the Brompton. In the days following the 8th May, the rain-gods
were smiling on me and I wore shorts. I got the 6.4 miles down to 5.8
miles by a change of route. South London is surprisingly hilly, but
finding a route that follows a railway line seems to give an
improvement, and in this case a shorter route. The front pannier is
ideal for taking laundry backwards and forwards.
<P>
If there is any bad news, it's that a Brompton feels heavy after you
have folded it and carried it up a flight of stairs (in this case, to
Kinnier Wilson Ward in Ruskin Wing). A bag would be a great improvement
and maybe I'll get one. And don't expect the doctors and nurses to
admire the machine because they have other things on their mind.
<P>
I cycled to Camberwell every day for 12 days (sometimes twice a day),
which is a lot of miles. If anyone reading this is considering buying a
folding bike, I can truly say that the Brompton is a REAL BIKE, and a
6-mile journey is easy.
<P>
After 12 days she was sent back to Lewisham Hospital, which is only 2
miles away, so again I cycled. There are no facilities for cycles there,
just a curious old bike-rack of a type I thought had long gone - a
curved steel trough which is too narrow for mountain-bike tyres, and
bent into a radius that fits 26-inch wheels and nothing else.
<P>
Because of this illness, my wife has retired from her job as a
Headteacher. She is feeling better but cannot go far because I have sold
her car (it may be a year before she can drive again). I have
tentatively mentioned buying a second Brompton, so that we can cycle
along canal towpaths (there are no hills on canals). I detect some
enthusiasm, but the word "canal" was a mistake. She is afraid of falling
in.
<P>
For the last 2 months the UK has been totally el-Nino'd and cycling had
been rained off. Now, suddenly, it's summer again - just in time for
autumn...


<H2><A NAME="290"></A>Brought to justice</H2>
<EM CLASS="from">Bob Gelman, Sep 1998:</EM><P>
Two funny stories about bringing a bike to work.  At the US Dept of
Justice in Washington, D.C., in the 1960s I brought my Atala to work and
foolishly leaned it near a radiator (is this the British term also for a
room heating outlet?).  Many fellow coworkers were rather taken aback by
what they perceived as a loud gunshot in the office when they tyre blew
up from the excessive heat on the tubular.  Same place, another time, I
chain locked the bike to a stairway handrail in the underground office
parking garage.  Finding the bike missing after work I made inquiry of a
guard.  Could this be?  A bike stolen from the bowels of the judicial
system of the federal government?  A guard informed me that they had my
bike and that the chain had been cut and the bike removed on the
instruction of one J. Edgar Hoover (head of the FBI) because he thought
it looked unsightly and out of place parked there!


<H2><A NAME="291"></A>10 drawer falling cabinets</H2>
<EM CLASS="from">Custfold, Oct 1998:</EM><P>
Our 'office' gained from a travel agency today - a set of 10 drawer 'filing
cabinets' for leaflets etc.  We saw the opportunity on the way back from the
shops and managed to fit one cabinet on the 12 pack of orange juice on the
rear carrier.
<BR>
Herself sent me back to get 'the rest' and I loaded 3 on the front rack, one
on the rear, and took the dud drawers and put them into the one which would
have been just a bit OTT - might go back Monday and take a look....
<BR>
So here I go off with 4 filing cabinets on the bike - sod's law has it that
I'm beating into a Westerly down Argyle St and then up to Charing Cross, when
the pothole I hit becomes that last straw, and the whole load up front pitches
forward, hangs for a few seconds and then dumps unceremoniously breaking the
front light, and landing in the road drawers everywhere.  I gather all up and
having spare straps stabilise the load across the main frame and lashed to the
seatpost I complete the trip on foot.
<BR>
Inspection reveals that the upper fixing screw was not in its hole (having
apparently worked loose as its pristine threads suggest. and with all the
weight on the lower one, this sheared, and the total strain also overwhelmed
the security strap around the head tube, collapsing part of the moulding.
<BR>
Truly an interesting result - I have redesigned the security clamp system to
inorporate an anti unscrewing element into the capscrew heads - especially the
upper one.  A filing cabinet weighs 13Kg - so I'd estimate the front end was
carrying 34Kg including bracket, straps etc - but severely so with a moment of
say 170N acting on the bracket fixings.  Considering the manufacturers
recommendation is for a maximum load of 16Kg, and that with a considerably
reduced radius on which the moment acts its a b''' good design Mr Ritchie.  We
do howvever need to sort out the occasional loosening of the fixing screws -
such that the security is easily checked, and adjusted.
<BR>
I was particularly interested in the behaviour of the lower web of the front
block which compressed and deformed into a lip proud of the lower face.
Pictures then parts to Andrew I suspect.


<H2><A NAME="292"></A>Conductorial excitement</H2>
<EM CLASS="from">JP Desbru&egrave;hres, Oct 1998:</EM><P>
I have read some time ago an interesting chronicle about conductorial
excitement in railways which started from "Where do Bromptons live".
<BR>
I have been riding a Brompton in Paris for three years now and Andras
Toth is right when expressing his opinion on riding a Brompton in Paris

<BLOCKQUOTE>"The French are generally more loosely organized than the Anglosaxon,
this is perhaps the reason why I have been carrying my Brompton around
*everywhere* in Paris for the past one year. Actually, I consider it a
challenge to get into the most unlikely places with it. It has seen the
same amount of films in cinemas as I have, ..."</BLOCKQUOTE>
with three major exceptions:
<OL>
<LI>le Louvre
<LI>le jardin des Tuileries
<LI>Paris railway stations (SNCF)
</OL>
I have been sentenced by the "tribunal de police de Paris" to a 2000 FF
fine for watching the departure panel in gare de Lyon with my Brompton
alongside according to a "d&eacute;cret" signed by "Philippe P&eacute;tain" in the
good old times of the Vichy government (1942) when France was occupied
by the nazis.
<BR>
Because of my poor satisfaction about the first court decision the whole
thing is going through the appeal process and is programmed next
november &agrave; "la cour d'app&egrave;l de Paris".
<BR>
I enclose copy of a recent letter in French to Monsieur Gallois, head of
SNCF, in a huge and furious attempt to transform Brompton Talk into a
multicultural forum and to explain the French context. If you can't read
French it's just time to start learning it !
<BR>
For better comprehension of the events, let me summarize: I was arrested
by a small army (30 men because of terrorist alert) taken by the armed
force to the nearest police station. Consequences: I missed my train and
was sentenced as mentioned above.
<BR>
I would like to produce in court next november related foreign
regulations, customs and stories.
<BR>
Dear Brompton adddicts fellows,
I ask for your cooperation as foreign witnesses in my case against the
SNCF and the French prosecutor. Your emails will be welcomed. If you
happen to be in Paris at the time you are invited to the Palais de
justice, 13&egrave;me chambre 13h30 on november 17th. This would considerably
improve your French, will probably be an interesting piece of justice in
a court I hope crowded with Bromptons.
<BR>
Par la tr&egrave;s Sainte Culotte de Dieu! If the court decision is in my favor
I promise a drink and a following Brompton ride through the most
beautiful squares & parts of the city.
<BR>
I am looking forward to read your emails and possible presence, don't
forget the side issues: nicest city of the world, French lovers, jolies
mademoiselles and good food, cheese, wines, choucroute, cassoulet,
daube, ...
<BR>
Sorry for this too long message.

<BR>
<BR>Recommand&eacute;e avec A.R.
<BR>Monsieur le Pr&eacute;sident,
<BR>
Sur votre d&eacute;nonciation et sur votre demande en tant que partie civile,
j'ai &eacute;t&eacute; condamn&eacute; par un jugement du tribunal de police en date du
12/12/1997 &agrave; 2000F d'amende et 1F de dommages et int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts &agrave;
la partie civile pour avoir utilis&eacute; vos installations en un &eacute;quipage qui ne
plaisait pas &agrave; vos agents. Vos diligents services pourront s&ucirc;rement vous
communiquer une copie du jugement.
<BR>
J'ai fait appel de cette d&eacute;cision qui m'appara&icirc;t inique et, de plus,
bas&eacute;e sur des textes n'ayant plus aucune valeur l&eacute;gale comme ce glorieux
d&eacute;cret de mars 1942 invoqu&eacute; avec tant d'&agrave;-propos et de sagacit&eacute;
par vous et vos agents, et d&eacute;cor&eacute; de la belle signature du Mar&eacute;chal
P&eacute;tain, noble
vainqueur de Verdun et chef v&eacute;n&eacute;r&eacute; par les technocrates de tous bords
(voir Maurice Papon) et aussi chef supr&ecirc;me collaborateur d'un pays
militairement occup&eacute; et donc condamn&eacute; &agrave; mort pour haute trahison
quelques trois ans plus tard.
<BR>
J'ai &eacute;t&eacute; convoqu&eacute; devant la 13&egrave;me chambre de la cour d'appel
de Paris
pour l'audience du 17 novembre 1998. Vos diligents services ainsi que
les serpilli&egrave;res qui vous entourent et conseillent en sont certainement
inform&eacute;s.
<BR>
Mon insistance m'a enfin permis d'avoir acc&egrave;s aux pi&egrave;ces du dossier et
de d&eacute;couvrir ainsi, entre autres, que les fameux comp&egrave;res de la SNCF,
PLLER et PLLOC ou PLLOUC, &agrave; moins que ce ne soit PLLIC peut-&ecirc;tre,
dissimul&eacute;s sous ces acronymes abscons, se nommaient en r&eacute;alit&eacute;: Barthe
Wilfrid et Leroy Christophe. J'aurais du mal &agrave; vous d&eacute;crire ma joie
devant ma d&eacute;couverte, dans le confort douillet du bureau de l'avocat
g&eacute;n&eacute;ral, du joli talent de plume des joyeux duettistes de la milice du
rail. J'ai pass&eacute; un tr&egrave;s d&eacute;lirant et tr&egrave;s joyeux moment &agrave;
prendre
connaissance du rapport de votre police parall&egrave;le. C'est un &eacute;v&eacute;nement
litt&eacute;raire de premi&egrave;re importance qui m'a marqu&eacute; profond&eacute;ment et
aussi
un t&eacute;moignage poignant et fascinant. Je vous reproduis un modeste et
savoureux extrait du fameux duo cheminot (PLLIC et PLLOC ?):
"Celui-ci (le signataire du pr&eacute;sent courrier) tenait des propos
d&eacute;nigrants et vexatoires &agrave; notre &eacute;gard. Avec beaucoup de complaisance,
il nous vilipendait aupr&egrave;s des voyageurs pr&eacute;sents sur les lieux,
s'attirant ainsi leur sympathie."
<BR>
Un v&eacute;ritable chef d'oeuvre !
Il serait surprenant que PLLIC et PLLOC aient assez de culture pour
savoir que m&eacute;pris, morgue et suffisance sont les principales armes dont
disposent ceux qui se trouvent d&eacute;sarm&eacute;s &agrave; la merci d'une force arm&eacute;e
imb&eacute;cile. Je vous engage vivement, si l'&eacute;tat de votre prostate vous le
permet encore, &agrave; lire l'int&eacute;gralit&eacute; de ce document exceptionnel en
imaginant Fernandel et Bourvil, tous deux en grande forme, interpr&eacute;tant
les joyeux duettistes du rail.
<BR>
Soyez heureux, Monsieur le Pr&eacute;sident, vous avez obtenu du tribunal de
police ma condamnation pour blasph&egrave;me, c'est un grand pas en avant pour
l'&eacute;rection de votre statue en Dieu sans goudron ni plumes et chevauchant
un rail.
<BR>
C'est aussi une premi&egrave;re cheminotte qui vous met dans la meilleure
posture pour obtenir le poste le plus envi&eacute; par tous les sp&eacute;cialistes du
transport et des mauvais proc&egrave;s, celui de patron des chemins de fer
iraniens et malaisiens r&eacute;unis et r&eacute;nov&eacute;s.
Cela nous rappelle le bon vieux temps d'avant le rail, celui de la
sainte inquisition o&ugrave; l'on br&ucirc;lait joyeusement sorci&egrave;res, juifs,
h&eacute;r&eacute;tiques et blasph&eacute;mateurs divers sur de grands b&ucirc;chers
destin&eacute;s &agrave;
&eacute;clairer les nuits d'&eacute;t&eacute; et &agrave; prot&eacute;ger,
promouvoir la vraie foi.
Cela nous rappelle encore, douloureusement, un temps cruel, bien plus
r&eacute;cent, presqu'hier, le temps des chaudi&egrave;res infernales o&ugrave;
les wagons &agrave;
bestiaux frapp&eacute;s de l'embl&egrave;me SNCF ornaient joliment la gare
d'Auschwitz-Birkenau dans la puanteur des fum&eacute;es des fours cr&eacute;matoires
que leurs cargaisons alimentaient.
Je parlerai de tout cela &agrave; Salman Rushdie, cela va l'int&eacute;resser, il
n'est pas certain qu'il puisse en rire, il n'est pas assur&eacute; qu'il ait
l'humour cheminot.
<BR>
Toutefois, avant cette audience, je veux vous donner une derni&egrave;re chance
de vous repentir, vous et surtout votre institution-administration, pour
sa tr&egrave;s grande ob&eacute;issance de trait d'union obligeant entre l'exclusion
et l'extermination pendant la p&eacute;riode sc&eacute;l&eacute;rate d'o&ugrave;
vous tirez encore
et toujours la source de vos r&egrave;glements actuels. Je veux, bien s&ucirc;r,
parler de la p&eacute;riode de Vichy, de l'autorit&eacute; de fait impos&eacute;e
au pays &agrave;
la faveur de la d&eacute;faite devant l'ennemi nazi et dont vous utilisez fort
opportun&eacute;ment les textes pour poursuivre, dans de mauvais proc&egrave;s, ceux
qui vous d&eacute;plaisent dans des conditions qui ignorent les r&egrave;gles
&eacute;l&eacute;mentaires du droit.
<BR>
Je veux vous donner une chance, encore, de vous retirer, de vous
souvenir, de vous repentir avant que le ridicule et le tragique associ&eacute;s
ne soient trop grands, qu'ils vous submergent (le ridicule est pour
l'autorit&eacute; du chef le plus grand des p&eacute;rils) et c'est pourquoi je vous
adresse ci-joint le reportage photographique que j'ai r&eacute;alis&eacute; sur les
plaques et monuments aux morts des gares et prisons parisiennes,
reportage compl&eacute;t&eacute; par une photo d'archive que je compte &eacute;galement
remettre &agrave; la cour d'appel avec mes commentaires.
Cette derni&egrave;re photo qui repr&eacute;sente une livraison de femmes et d'enfants
juifs &agrave; Auschwitz-Birkenau par un wagon SNCF est insupportable lorsqu'on
conna&icirc;t les intentions des bourreaux nazis pour les minutes qui suivent:
petite vapeur malodorante, merci la SNCF !
Ce clich&eacute; illustrerait parfaitement, d'une mani&egrave;re sinistre, vos slogans
habituels: "A la SNCF rien d'impossible" ou bien "A nous de vous faire
pr&eacute;f&eacute;rer le train". Je vous invite, avec insistance, &agrave; vous souvenir,
&agrave;
lui r&eacute;server une place de choix dans le grand livre d'or qui retrace
l'histoire de votre grande et belle compagnie. Je vous invite pour
r&eacute;pondre &agrave; ce qui devrait &ecirc;tre votre ardente obligation de repentir et
souvenir &agrave; y cr&eacute;er une section "horreurs".
<BR>
Rien que pour cette effroyable image, je ne supporterais pas la simple
vue de ma carte de visite, je changerais aussit&ocirc;t le nom, le sigle
souill&eacute;s.
<BR>
Soyez assur&eacute; que je ferai tous mes efforts pour faire valoir mon droit
et obtenir votre condamnation.
<BR>
Veuillez recevoir l'expression de mes sentiments distingu&eacute;s.

<H2><A NAME="293"></A>Conductorial excitement, part 2</H2>
<EM CLASS="from">JP Desbru&egrave;hres, Nov 1998:</EM><P>
"L'audience solennelle de la cour d'appel du tribunal de grande instance de Paris"
was held on the 23rd of november as scheduled.
<BR>
The president directing the proceedings was keen on trying to keep the
Brompton rider's talk low. My Brompton was at the back of the court room
under the kindly guard of a smiling "gendarme" fully armed. The
president declined my polite offer to bring Mr Brompton at the front of
the judicial arena under the rostrum. But I must say that everybody's
attention was focused on Mr folded Brompton at the back of the room.
<BR>
After a short cross-examination about the circumstances of the crime and
a condensed presentation of my defence's arguments the SNCF lawyer asked
again the court to heavily sentence the blasphemy. Then the public
prosecutor half sleeping muttered something like "application de la
loi".
<BR>
Speaking the last after the president expressed the opinion that from a
mouse we had all made a mountain I asked the court to protect the SNCF
customers "des bouff&eacute;es d'autorit&eacute; de ses petits chefs" and to be
discharged. I further asked the court to decide that the SNCF should pay
me 50000 French Francs for "abus de constitution de partie civile".
<BR>
The president adressing all the parties declared that the court will
thoroughly examine all documents and arguments, takes its decision on
february 16th 1999 and that the audience was closed.
<BR>
If you wish I will let you know.
<BR>
Mr folded brompton was softly applauded when I left the court carrying
him.
<BR>
Then it was great to unfold and ride Mr Brompton in the courtyards of
this old palace prison along "la sainte chapelle" under the amused
glance of the best Paris police forces.
<P>
Thanks to all for your warm supports. Thanks to the Folding Society for
publishing my rail blasphemies.


<H2><A NAME="294"></A>Morocco</H2>
<EM CLASS="from">JP Desbru&egrave;hres, Dec 1998:</EM><P>
I have been in Morocco with my girlfriend and two L5 Bromptons this year
in february.
<BR>
The reaction of the people was generally speaking nice to us. Bromptons
were as you can imagine raising a lot of curiosity.
<BR>
I would not leave my Brompton even well locked when visiting the souks
in Marrakech. We have been riding quite successfully our Bromptons
inside the souks. If you don't speak French you should learn a little.
<BR>
I recommend biking in the Atlas mountains. Beautiful sceneries, nice
people and villages.
We have also been to Essaouira (try to reserve a room in the hotel "La
villa Maroc"), the old Mogador looking from the remparts on the "&icirc;les
purpurines".
<BR>
We have been biking in the hills around the old Mogador and I will
always remember my red Brompton sitting in the middle of a market place
where the people, the goods, the donkeys, the mud were just as they were
in Palestine at Christ's time. Not a single car in sight, just men
dressed as they were in Palestine, donkeys and an incongruous red
Brompton in the middle. We were offered tea, drugs and strange products
and my friend was the only human female in the crowd. Nothing dangerous,
nothing unfriendly though.
<BR>
Try Morocco, if the weather is good, if you speak a little French you
will certainly enjoy it. It's not travelling through space, it's
travelling through time.


<H2><A NAME="295"></A>Aeroplanes</H2>
<EM CLASS="from">John Blackburn, Apr 1999:</EM><P>
I know one pilot who needed a folding bike - the one in a large
piston-engined ex-fighter marked "China Air Force" that I met at an Air
Show. He leapt out of it, ran up to me and said "can I borrow your
bike?". He explained that he had left vital documents at the Flight
Office or some such place and couldn't leave without them. Unfortunately
the Flight Office was the other side of the airfield. So I lent him my
bike - a Raleigh road-bike; after all, I now had a Chinese Fighter as
security (and taxying it across the airfield would probably have used
about 10 gallons of fuel; I felt sorry for him).
<BR>
He was back in 10 minutes, waving his documents. He thanked me, climbed
into his machine, and was gone. Unfortunately, so was my expensive
Blackburn bicycle-pump. It must have fallen off in the excitement. It
took a lot of effort finding a narrow-bore pump that could easily manage
100 psi/6 bar, and in a trice I had lost it.


<H2><A NAME="296"></A>Arnold conquers New York</H2>
<EM CLASS="from">Richard Lighton, May 1999:</EM><P>
Others have been much further on Bromptons, but yesterday Arnold (my T5)
and about 40,000 other bikes participated in the New York City 5 Boro
ride--42 miles through New York City, from the southern tip of Manhattan
to Staten Island by a very indirect route. (We came back by the direct
route, the Staten Island Ferry.)
<BR>
This was an entirely non-competitive event with all sorts of bicycles.
I did not see any high wheelers (penny farthings), but there weresuch
strange things as a four wheeled four seat pedal car and a sort of tandem
with the riders side by side, one on each side of the bike.
<BR>
Arnold and I did not disgrace ourselves--we passed far more bikes than
passed us, and I got one comment as I zoomed round a corner and up a mild
slope past a couple of road bikes of "Now _that's_ embarrassing!" The
small wheels attracted a lot of attention, as did the bike in the parked
position--there were a couple of long waits, one at the start, one in
midtown Manhattan. I was talking to someone at thefinish, and he
commented on the small wheels so I demonstrated the compact form of the
bike. That attracted a small crowd. And a couple who were loading their
bikes onto racks as I folded Arnold up and put him in the rather crowded
trunk of my fairly small car expressed envy!
<BR>
So for those who have recently been asking about the ability of Bromptons
to handle reasonable distances, a T5 with 12% gear reduction, Primos,
a B-66 Brooks saddle, and the extending seat pillar (I'm 6ft 2--1.83m)
had a lot of fun (so did I) on a 42 mile/68km ride over fairly level
ground yesterday and I'll be cycling to work in about half an hour.
A Brompton _is_ a bicycle!
<BR>
As an added disclaimer, Arnold is the only bike I have owned or ridden
since the mid 60s and I am not an athlete.



Subject: A Brompton adventure in America
<EM CLASS="from">Peter, Jun 1999:</EM><P>
This past Saturday, June 12, 1999, was the inaugural run of the Palo
Alto Brompton Classic. A group of bicycle enthusiasts came to the home
of the Brompton American agent at 423 Chaucer St., in Palo Alto,
California. None of them had ridden a Brompton before, but they were
prepared for a grueling ordeal of folding and unfolding and folding and
unfolding and so on and so forth.
<BR>
They understood that a Brompton was not to be tested with a hill or a
mountain or any number of mountains. So their route was planned to
include an art museum, a 200 foot observation tower, a church, a cafe,
a sculpture garden, a train, a bus, a grocery store, a bike store (to
dazzle the unknowing with the grace and elegance of Bromptons), and a
restaurant (for lunch). All to take place in and around the city of
Palo Alto and the Stanford University campus. They came prepared with
copies of a marked map of the complete run, bearing the noble title,
"Palo Alto Brompton Classic".
<BR>
As it turned out, about half the total time of this Brompton Classic was
spent in the restaurant, making it impossible to meet the overall ride
schedule. And after observing the compact folded size of a Brompton,
the staff at the observation tower said they would be delighted to
allow any Brompton up to the top---on any other day. This was the day
before the Stanford graduation, so unfortunately the tower was
overcrowded.
<BR>
And the church had a service going on inside, not clear what, in the
middle of a Saturday afternoon. However, the Rodin sculpture garden was
on the other hand completely accessible, a veriable romp for the
Bromptons, an
excellent terrain to demonstrate the superior maneuverability of a
small wheeled bicycle (small in wheels, but not small in spirit).
<BR>
When the Brompton Classic crew returned to home base they found a
confused cyclist riding his cumbersome up and down Chaucer St. He asked
if anyone knew of a bike shop in the neighborhood. The Classic riders
immediately understood he must be looking for a Brompton store. But not
a store in this case, rather a house with ample storage and shop space
for Bromptons, plus Internet connections to Bromptonites the world
over. The Palo Alto Classic riders offered him the use of one of their
machines (with typical local hospitality I might add!), and so he too
had a chance to sample a Brompton, and returned with a wide smile on
his face.
<BR>
At least so I was told it all happened just this way.  For my wife and
I it was a devil's dilemma from the start---to ride the very first Palo
Alto Classic, or go to San Francisco to support our son in an important
windsurfing event. We went to watch him and he won the race! Of course
I took my Brompton to the race and also took a newly assembled Julian
Nuess Brompton Recumbent to deliver to a happy new owner. One of my =
son's friends, Jim, rode the Brompton recumbent around the harbor area =
to the delight and curious stares of many onlookers. Jim pronounced it =
to be:
"Hey, a sweet machine!".
<BR>
Ah well, next year we can join an overwhelming international crowd for
the 2nd Palo Alto Classic! Refreshments will be served, and there's a
chance we might even complete as much as half of the course---as long
as there's no dawdling in the restaurant this time.
<BR>
The above mostly attributed to Peter Nurkse, The Classic leader. He =
further comments:
When I got home, Frances and I went across the street to show off our
new bikes to Jim Langley. NOTE: Jim is former technical editor and =
current guest writer,  for BICYCLING Magazine.  Jim showed us how to =
unfold in one sweeping
motion, with a crucial foot strategically placed in front of the
rear wheel. He was almost able to show us how to fold in one sweeping
motion too, but not quite. We hope to have breakfast rides with Jim and
his wife, Deb, they on their Moultons, and we on our Bromptons. Jim
would of course ride his Brompton, I'm sure, except Deb has a Moulton,
so she shouldn't feel out of place.
<BR>
Look forward to the Second Palo Alto Brompton Classic, thanks for
offering refreshments, that might cut down the time in the restaurant.


<H2><A NAME="297"></A>Try a little tenderness</H2>
<EM CLASS="from">Peter, Jun 1999:</EM><P>
I just got back last night from a 7 day trip away. With a delayed
flight and a missed connection, I arrived after Frances had fallen
asleep.
<BR>
Checking up on Frances, I noticed her Brompton (or, Brommie, we aren't
saying Brompton any more) was sitting folded up at the foot of her bed.
And then I saw my own Brommie wasn't any longer in the living room
where I'd left it.
<BR>
Didn't think about that any more, unwound a bit, read a paper, then
went to sleep myself.
<BR>
But there was a big lump on my side of the bed, wrapped up in a sheet,
tucked in under the covers. Pulling up on the sheet, I found out it was
my Brommie, all folded and cuddled up there next to Frances.

Of course, I removed the Brommie right away, but it was a touching
sight. Only possible I think with a folding bike, really. Even if you
could get a conventional cumbersome bike under the covers, with all
that messy exposed chain, it still wouldn't be very substantial, no
compact mass, even wrapped up it wouldn't begin to be cuddly.

<EM CLASS="from">Geoff Law, Sep 1999:</EM><P>
A friend of mine, Barbara,  is over here in the west at present visiting
from Sydney.

<P>On Sunday, the day for our traditional HPV meeting on the cappucino strip,
I asked her if she wanted to accompany me down there.
<P> Now this lady is definitely not a cyclist, it's been literally years
since she was anything other than a stationary bike in a gym  ("I can't
figure out the 'dials' on the handlebars" ) and it's close to 60km round
trip, so we took the route closest to the railway line just in case. I
figured the Brompton would be her best bet as it has VERY simple gears
(just 3) and a sprung Brooks seat (a friend kindly donated a sheepskin
cover for the return leg). I took my bikeE.
<P>Well, she covered the whole journey on the Brommie without a murmer,
except for a few minutes when I gave her a go on the bikeE, which she
hated! On the bikeE she was soooo tense, teeth clenched, knuckles going
white, etc etc.   I couldn't bear to watch, so I took it back.
<P>The only problem was she was faster than me most of the time, especially
uphill, where she really gave me a caning! I was able to leave her for dead
downhill though.  She thinks I was specially going slow for her benefit, so
I let her believe that. Why spoil her fun?
<P>She's off sightseeing now, so today I fitted the bikeE out with a 11-34
rear cluster and long cage derailleur to help out on those hills,  and the
Brommie got a new chain, both chains dipped in molten parrafin wax.
(Oops,don't want to start a chain lube thread here folks!)
<P>Barbara really loved the Brompton. It's such a no-fuss bike to ride, also
I notice every time I climb on it, just how efficient it is on converting
pedalling to forward motion. Despite the little wheels with their michelin
tyres , rated at only 45psi, It rolls really easily. Don't ask me to
explain it!
<P>
The bike, which is about 16 years old, came from a garage sale with
Michelin Universal tyres, made in England,  16 x 1 3/8. They look really
old, with some cracking of the sidewalls, and I don't use a gauge, just
pumping them up till they feel hard. Haven't had a puncture yet!
<P>Despite its age, and lack of alloy, when you get on this bike, it's very
noticeable how easy it is to ride. There's hardly any resistance in the
drivetrain either. I'm faster on the Brommie than on my Moulton APB, which
has 14 gears.


<H2><A NAME="299"></A>Brommie in Hawai'</H2>
<EM CLASS="from">De Clarke, Oct 1999:</EM><P>
I had some fun with my little red Brompton while in Hilo.
<P>
Earlier in my trip (when attending a technical
conference) I was at a resort carefully engineered to be
bike-impossible. Though one could, for a large fee, go
on an orchestrated mountain-bike ride in the hills
around Waimea (cattle ranching country), the resort
itself was definitely a "bike free zone".
<P>
I could, if sufficiently determined, have taken the Brom
down 4 floors in an elevator, wheeled it along about 1/4
mile of carpeted corridor, exited via a fire door
(through which I could not re-enter), wheeled the bike
over another 1/4 mile of manicured lawn, and finally
found an asphalt service road which ran around the
resort perimeter.  From this road I could eventually
have got to (big excitement) the parking lot, or some
dead-end asphalt paths through the golf course.  From
the parking lot I could have got to another road which
would take me past some other resorts and to a shopping
mall... anyway, you get the picture.  There was no
interesting biking to be done there and the inside of
the 62-acre resort property was totally bike-negative.
<P>
But after the conference was over I went down to spend a
couple of days in Hilo (a great town).  Stayed at a mid-
range B&amp;B on the Hilo waterfront, and there the Brommie
got to go for some rides.  I wish I had taken a couple
of pictures but am not much of a snapshot fan so I kept
forgetting to bring a camera.  So I can't publish a GIF
of "a Brompton in Hilo" -- too bad. Despite lots of
broken glass on the road I managed not to get a flat
tyre (whew).
<P>
As it turns out, the teenagers in Hawaii right now are
really into small-wheel bikes.  They are riding low 16-
and 14-in wheeled frames, mostly 1-speeds, dressing them
up with chrome and tassels like Harley choppers.  I
thought the funny little red bike would be laughed at,
but quite the reverse -- the kids thought my high-riser
bars and teeny wheels were "ono" ("great", "the best").
<P>
I biked to the Port of Hilo deep-draught dock, where the
cruise ships and cargo barges tie up, and hung out with
the longshoremen.  They loved the bike, especially when
they saw it parked ("sit, Brommie!").  When I folded it
they were delighted.  Riding home one night after dark I
passed a couple of surfer dudes (one on a "cool kid"
bike and the other skate boarding); as I passed them in
4th gear they tried to race, but couldn't keep up on
their slower vehicles.  "Killer your bike, brah!" yelled
one of them ("That's a killer bike you have there,
brother.")
<P>
So the little Brommie, far from attracting giggles and
stares, attracted admiration!  I was warned by my B&amp;B
hosts not to leave it anywhere unattended -- "a regular
bike might be OK, but a cute little bike like that would
be too much temptation."  These folks also were charmed
by the folder and wanted to know where they could get
one.  Channell, if you get an order from Hilo anytime
soon, it's probably from them.
<P>
Travelling with a Brompton is a great way to make
friends. Except, of course, among ticket collectors, air
freight clerks, etc :-)
<P>
I recommend Hilo heartily to anyone travelling to
Hawai'i. The terrain is fairly flat on the ocean side of
town, and there are lots of interesting things going on.
<P>
Every Saturday the local brass band plays in the park
for free, and there's a large street market with great
tropical produce and local handicrafts.  Old Town is
shabby and comfortable -- lots of good food reasonably
priced, and nice shops for those who enjoy tourist
shopping. Plenty of good swimming and fishing spots
along the coast road.  Don't swim or snorkel in the
harbour though, there really are hammerheads in there.
<P>
An ambitious biker could make a nice road trip South
along the main highway towards Volcano and the national
park (where live lava is still flowing).

<EM CLASS="from">Alex Mumzhiu, Dec 1999:</EM><P>
I am going on a trip around the Indochina peninsula  (Thailand, Cambodia,
Vietnam, Laos, Burma, Thailand) on Jan 13.  I have made several long
distance trips on Dahon bikes in last  6 years, this time I will take a
Brompton, which I recently purchased  in Tokyo.  The whole trip will take
about a month and a half, not all of it will be covered on the bike. I
prefer to cover the boring, not interesting, long distance parts of the trip
by bus, taxi, train,  ferry and so on taking advantage of the folding
capability.  I found that travelling on a folding bike is the most
enjoyable, easiest, convenient, safest and cheapest way to travel. I have a
sort of minimalistic  approach to travel  so I keep all of my personal
belongings, in a little backpack which sits on the rear rack of my bike.
This makes me completely self-reliable  like a nomad and gives me incredible
mobility.  I do not make advanced hotel reservations. Normally, I stay in a
hotel for just one night and leave the following morning.  As the next night
approaches, I just find another hotel along the way using the "Lonely
Planet" book. This mode of transportation saves a great deal of time and
money.  I don't have to rely on rip-off taxi drivers or unknown local public
transportation.  My taxi is always with me.  With a good  map, which I
always try to buy in advance, it is easy to find your way around everywhere.
It is also a very safe way of traveling.  Criminals, who pray on the
tourists, have a certain target in mind and a certain strategy for attack.
When they encounter something so completely unexpected, like an adult man
riding a children's bicycle, they are unable to adjust their strategy quick
enough.  A bicycle is also faster then a man.  I traveled  on my bike to
places that tourists newer see such as  Rio's favelas or South Bronx.
Nothing happened.  However,  maneuvering  in the city  requires very good
reflexes and bicycling skills; you must jump constantly from the pavement to
the side-walk and back,  jump across the potholes and watch for approaching
cars, this is why I am against  all sorts of trailers. I usually travel
alone.  While traveling alone, I never feel lonely.  I am always surrounded
by the warm attention of local people.  The emergence of an adult man riding
a "children's" size funny bicycle always creates a lot of excitement between
the dwellers of  Rio-De-Janeiro favelas and the strollers of  Paris
boulevards, equally.  Children get most exited, as they think I am a clown
returning from the circus.  People always ask me to give them my bicycle for
a ride.  I have pictures of many different people riding my bicycle,
including a Buddhist monk in the saffron  rob, a Mexican policeman in
complete uniform, a Burmese man in a long sarong and a Bangkok "bar girl".

Why "Arnold" did I hear you ask? Well, when I got my T5 in August, I decided
that it needed a name.
Nobody came up with one at the time, but when I made mention of the T5 later

immediately my daughter
named the bike "Arnold."

In the office, he of course is next to my desk.
While commuting, he just fits in between 2 seats (in these dutch trains
where the seats are placed with the back to each other).
An other very special place is in the pub in Amsterdam where I frequently
go. His place is under a small staircase, the place is almost as small as

I can remember using (prescribing) this. At the time there was little in the

Yes the Brompton cocktail. Very appropriate for America's halloween

With patents, they start out with the first claim being very
general and gradually get more specific.  They are only a license
to sue someone - if you don't prosecute them then they can ignore
your patent completely, and it may cost you more to do this than
to forget about them.  A court might see infringing a very broad
claim as being not too bad.

The patent includes a diagram of a 1980 Brompton, which looks quite odd.

oh, surely "to bromp", as in "I took a little

of course, here in the States no dedicated jargon-head

transit planners here would obviously talk about
"bromptonizing" and "forming a working group to study
the cost/benefit aspects of bromptonization".
<BR>
actually now that I consider it, "to brom" has its
appeal also.  "There I was, just  bromming along"
has a nice ring.  Perhaps "to brompt" refers to the
sensation of riding on a roughish surface, whereas
"to brom" indicates the swan-like serene glide of
a well-metalled road (or linoleum ;->)  Or perhaps
one "brompts" to work, but "broms" for fun?

the more medically-inclined could refer to
"bromptonation" as a means of forward progress.
