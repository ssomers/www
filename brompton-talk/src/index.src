Here are some lovely lightweight HTML pages with an organized collection of mails to the Brompton-Talk mailing list from 1996 up to 2005 (with a few edits up to 2007). The list was set up and sponsored by Bromptonbike USA, i.e., Channel Wasson.

Earlier this century, you could find more up to date info in a modern wiki version over at the demised wikispaces and in a yahoo group, but I can't find either anymore.
