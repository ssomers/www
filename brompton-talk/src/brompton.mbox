Rear tyres get a lot more punctures than front ones.  To explain why, it
helps to outline the different ways that you can get a puncture:

1. The inner tube gets pinched.  This happens if there is a heavy
   load on the wheel (rear wheels typically carry 60-65% of the weight 
   on a bicycle) and if the tyre isn't pumped up hard enough.

   I found that I got punctures a lot less often once I bought a decent
   track pump, that has an accurate guage and can pump a tyre easily up 
   to 100psi (7 atmospheres).  When you have a nice pump, its quick and
   easy to pump up your tyres, so you do it more often, and with a good
   quality guage, you can tell when you have a slow puncture.  This means
   that you can fix problems in the warm and dry and not by the roadside.

   The other time when inner tubes get pinched is if you snag them under
   the bead of the tyre when you repair a flat.  The symptom for this is 
   if you get a puncture a few miles after fixing another.  For me, the
   solution to this problem was to watch whilst a mechanic fixed a puncture.
   Reading any number of descriptions in magazines and books didn't work 
   for me.

2. The tyre gets punctured by a thorn, nail, piece of glass etc.  These 
   happen more often in the wet as the rubber of the tyre cuts more
   easily.  They also happen more often on the rear tyre.  If you ride
   over a nail or thorn in the road, then it will probably be lying on
   its side.  This isn't a problem for the front tyre, but every so
   often, the thorn gets plinged up as the front tyre passes over it,
   so that when the rear tyre comes along, the thorn is pointing
   straight up.  Its worth scanning the road ahead carefully to try and
   avoid riding over debris.

   Tyres with a thick outer layer help for some punctures, if they
   stop a thorn from penetrating the casing.  However a thinner and
   more supple tyre might have been able to survive the same thorn
   by flexing out of the way.  The thinner tyre will also be lighter
   and roll much more smoothly.

3. A patch comes loose on the inner tube.  Its best to carry a spare inner 
   tube with you and repair the punctured one when you get home.  This
   gives the rubber solution longer to cure.  It also means that you
   have a spare in case the inner tube is beyond repair (eg a puncture
   near the valve), and it means you don't have to mess about with
   instant patches.

4. The tyre overheats when you brake heavily going down a hill.  Sometimes its 
   safer to ride down a hill quickly, so you lose more energy to air
   resistance than riding down slowly using the brakes.  If you do
   this, the rim and tyre get hot and this can increase the chance of a
   puncture.

I used to get a lot more punctures than I do now.  Keeping tyres
properly inflated, repairing them correctly, avoiding road debris
and buying decent quality tyres is what I have done to help this.

For Bromptons, Primo tyres are suscecptible to punctures from
thorns and broken glass but are pretty good other than that.

> Does Kevlar tape or belted wheels PREVENT punctures? If not why pay

They help against some punctures by sharp objects.  However, a 
thin sharp shard of glass will still get through the Kevlar and
so they aren't a 100% guarantee.

Puncture resistant tapes like Tuffy Tape seem to cause more punctures
than they save as the joint between the ends of the tape can rub
the inner tube.

> Does anyone use slime? Is it any good?

I don't use it.  Its supposed to be good for punctures from
sharp objects.  A problem is that you can't repair an
inner tube that has been slimed if it does have a puncture.

The problem is that I can't tell the difference between a 100psi
tyre and a 70psi tyre without a pressure guage.  When you use a
pressure guage, you are likely to lose a little air in any case
when you connect the pump up.  Routinely pumping the tyres up
is easier than leaving them, and then finding out that you've had a
slow leak when you get a puncture.

> So 2 out of 3 of your suggestions are errors !

Yep.  I've made all of them too.

Experienced cyclists don't tend to get many punctures even if
they cycle much further than inexperienced cyclists.  They 
sub-consciously do the right things to avoid them.


BTW I found to my cost that , solid tyres are a good way of exchanging
problems with punctures, with problems with buckled wheels.  They also
have a lot of rolling resistance, poor grip and poor ride.  They are
_extremely_ difficult to fit.  Its easier and cheaper to learn how to use
pneumatic tyres without getting punctures.

Its still worth carrying a spare unopened tube around with you.

That is a lot of punctures.  I would expect to have had
between 0 and 4 punctures from cycling the same distance.

I don't know of a polite way of saying it, but some of these
punctures are probably caused by factors that you can avoid.  

When you have a puncture, try to work out why it happened.  They
are always caused by something and if you fix the symptom and not
the cause, then you'll get another soon.  Do you cycle where there
is a lot of broken glass, shards of stone or thorns?  Do you use
instant repair patches?

You say that you don't remove the wheel inner tube to repair a
puncture.  In that case you need to make sure that the rubber
solution on the patch has long enough to set before you put it
back.  When you put the inner tube back into the tyre, you
_have_ to make sure that the tyre bead doesn't snag on the inner
tube.  If it does, then you will be able to pump the tyre up but
it will leak again within a few miles.

As I said before, when I started cycling a lot I got a load of
punctures that were caused by me snagging the tube under the tyre
bead.  I only realised about this when I stood over the shoulder
of a mechanic at a bike shop and watched him repair one.
Now when I've put the inner tube back, I pump it up a little
and work it around with my fingers to make sure its well away
from the rim.

If it was caused by a piece of glass, then it could still be
sticking through the tyre casing.  Another possible problem
would be if the rim tape has sharp edges or is letting the
ends of the spokes touch the inner tube.  Cloth rim tape is
supposed to be better than the plastic ones.

If you get a puncture when you load the bike up a lot, or when
you ride over a big bump, then it is probably because your tyres
aren't pumped up hard enough.

BTW, some advice for a new Brompton owner: try repairing a 
rear puncture at home before you really need to do it.
Removing the rear wheel isn't difficult when you know how,
but it might not be obvious when you are cold and wet at the 
roadside.  Its also worth checking to see that you can remove 
the tyre easily.  With my (1996) Brompton it was really difficult
to get one of the Raleigh Records off the rim even with a full 
set of tools.

Not one to do the subject to death, I can confirm that fitting a pair of Aztec brake blocks to my '98 L5 has made a significant business to the brakes retardation ability and puts off the need to upgrade to Mk III brakes for a little while longer.  However, I can never get those darn Saccon brakes to centre properly and the constant "rub - rub" noise of block on rim may force an upgrade yet.

Gavin, I don't have any details on the Super-B (but see the archive), however it is good to see a fellow Brompton enthusiast from the North-East of Scotland.  My Primos have seen service in Aberdeen, Inverness, and points in between.  Small wheels are rare in this part of the world and I'm afraid the unenlightened greet my bikes with scorn - until I pass them, that is!

It is my opinion that Brompton have the brakes assembled incorrectly -
although I suspect it won't make any significant difference.

They do take a bit of a fiddle to set up and I recommend a strip-down of the
brake assembly to suss out how it is supposed to work. I've done this on the
rear brake. The last time I was in the bike shop, they commented that one of
the brake blocks wasn't working because they couldn't see it move when
applying the brake. This was because the block was so close to the rim. It
still came off when the brakes were released though.

I'm afraid the unenlightened greet my bikes with scorn - until I pass them,
that is!

It is rather good passing reasonable cyclists when they're on their racers.
In fact, on a leisurely ride recently, I HAD to pass the leader as he'd
slowed on a descent which due to the nature of the road surface and bend, I
didn't fancy slowing up that much !

improve your brakes dramatically by fitting softer brake blocks(I used
fibrax ones)...it saves the rims, you don't get the bits of ali grating into
the rim when you brake.I found the centering problem can be cured by taking
the calipers apart, cleaning the pivots and greasing them.Oiling the cables
also helps to maximise the power.

All good stuff. People are generally disgusted with the state of my bike,
but it's generlly well lubricated.

I have yet to solve these problems - I am still plagued by punctures. 

I need good grip with the rotten road surfaces in this country & 
especially the raised metal cover edges & drains everywhere. The 
"Records" have poor rather than bad grip. 

I solved the penetration punctures completely with antipuncture tape 
but now get "rub" punctures from the tape! However this type of 
puncture is much less frequent. I have used 2 types, a thin one where 
the excess tape overlaps - I get longtitudinal "cuts" along the 
overlap which renders the tube useless. I am trying to solve this at 
present by "filleting" an old tube & wrapping it around the inner 
tube so the tape can work on that rather than the tube itself. This 
dosn't happen with the other, thicker, tape but it has to be cut to 
size (lengthwise) but the cut ends rub through the tube! Any other 
bright ideas?!

Has anyone found a combined solution?

I'd accept metal drain covers - when wet they're always slippery.

I said they have better grip than the new Brompton tyres and i'd prefer them
and put up with the punctures rather than have Brompton's own tyres.

Hi there,
if you want good grip, low rolling resistance and good puncture protection 
try the Schwalbe Marathon. It scores excellent in all three departements. I 
use it on all my bikes for more than 5 years now.

Is it the chain that skips? On the chain-ring or on the sprocket? Have you replaced the chain without replacing the sprocket? If it skips in all three gears the fault should be with sprocket, chain or chain-ring. Otherwise the hub itself skips: www.sturmey-archer.com . As Andrew ponted out, you should not ride it then. The indicator chain is the tiny chain going through the locknut on the hub's right side. The gear cable pulls at it.

Thanks a lot - it was the next one on my list to try - I must make the
effort to get one !

To all concerned:

Please accept my apologies for the long delay in responding to some of your
e-mails -- I have been besieged with general inquiries for the new bike, at
a time when we are energetically finishing up the four-year-long capital-
and labor-intensive development of a vast assortment of incredible
componentry and state-of-the-art production fixtures and associated tooling.
I have been simultaneously engaged in the hectic and taxing process of
relocating my office, residence and workshop!

I know -- excuses, excuses!

In brief: In the first production runs, we are producing ten steel and then
ten Titanium rear triangles. These will accept our ultralight nine-speed
rear wheels. 

Attention UK & Europe: We will then begin production of the titanium
replacement rear triangles (two models) that accept Sturmey-Archer and
Shimano internally-geared hubs!

One can currently order full bikes in either 27-speed (9 x 3) or 18-speed (9
x 2) configurations. These consist of a Brompton frame (with numerous subtle
modifications and custom braze-on fittings for front derailleur, Shimano
V-brakes or Magura Hydrostops), cable stops and guides, etc.) mated to our
custom rear triangle, and equipped with ultralight, purpose-built
componentry of the finest calibre. For a glimpse, visit the (humble
beginnings) web site, if you haven't already done so
(www.ufbusa.com). Alternately, one can order rear triangles only, but
without our upgraded componentry, it would only be a starting point for a
future conversion. 

Exact pricing for the newest bikes is still uncertain, (until production
begins in the coming weeks, we won't know precisely how many hours the
fixtured building process will save from start to finish--we can only
estimate, based on our previous experience with entirely hand-built
versions, and the knowledge gained from initial work with the early
(partial) set of fixtures, which is a real stretch, as in production, the
most recent tooling and fixtures will reduce the building process by several
more hours!), and customers have been ordering the bikes with a variety of
component options which greatly affects the total price, but each generation
has been cheaper, and we are taking refundable deposits of as little as
$1500 to reserve bikes in this historic first production run. We have
pre-sold approximately 50% of the run already, so if you are seriously
interested, please contact us by e-mail or phone now (650-737-0303).

Our first priority is filling existing orders. I will be responding to all
general inquires individually in the next couple of weeks. For the time
being, your continued patience is profoundly appreciated.

Hi Stein,
ts ts, the lbs-situation in Ghent must be pretty desperate. Guess you have 
to come round your old favourite bike shop more often :)
Our spoke threading device is up and running for about a year now.

One little tip for the slightly heavier Bromtponist: Should you still 
experience problems due to spoke stress even after tightening the original 
wheel, have your rear wheel rebuilt with butted (2.34-2.00mm) stainless 
Sapim Strong spokes crossed only once (because of the better spoke angle at 
the rim entry).
These spokes are not available in the right length, but can be cut to size 
with... Yes, the above mentioned machine (We use a Hozan, cheap and cheerful 
and really essential for any Brompton dealer).
We did such a wheel for our heaviest customer (roughly 260lbs) and there 
haven't been any problems in over a year of harsh daily abuse.
Also make sure to have washers (M2.5) put under the spoke heads to emulate a 
thicker hub flange.

BTW: Stein, have you succeeded in killing your Sachs P5 again yet? The 3 
months are almost over ... ;)

Regards

Just to give you some accurate numbers: The consumer price of a Hozan spoke 
threading device (in expensive Europe) is roughly 150USD/Euro. It isn't the 
most elaborate but serves me rather well.

Hi all,
is there anyone on this list in Denmark?
I ask because I'm going to move there end of this/beginning of next year and 
I would like to find some soul mates.
Should you know anyone who's not on the list, please tell me, too.
Thank you very much.

Regards

Thorsten

Len,

This sounds okay to me.  As I spoke before . . . I'm interested in the
triangle, which I hope to install myself.  I have a trip in beginning
September for which I'd like to get a bike together.  Let me know if this is
possible and let's come up with a quote.  Note:  I had also mentioned
interest in possibly 2 triangles.

This is an interesting link that a friend passed on to me:
http://www.dto.ie/tranmap1.htm

Dublin is one of the more congested cities I have been to, and the
rapid growth of the Irish economy is outstripping their efforts to
tackle the problem -- I think much of the traffic to the port still
has to go through the city centre.

I have found that a tyre liner formerly marketed as Wolber Tape
to be effective in preventing punctures from thorns and
glass.Together with Schwalbe Special Marathon HS 159 tyres giving
as near 100o/o protection as one can get on a solo cycle.
Like all good products sorry to say both seem to be no longer
obtainable.
Should anyone be aware of a supplies of Wolber Tape, which lasts
for years, and is suitable for other brands of tyres, please
advise colin_heidi@tandems.fsnet.co.uk  thanks a lot.
Colin Foster.

After riding my Brompton for a year and a half I finally bought the =
telescopic saddle pin. Some 50 Euro for the 5 centimeters I need is a =
bit expensive, the main reason for doing without it. To make a short =
story shorter still, I should have bought it with the bike.=20
One disadvantage is that there are now two points for the saddle tube to =
slip. After the initial installation I made a trip, after every bad =
stretch of road I had to pull up the saddle to where I wanted it. Only =
after 50 kilometers I discovered that the upper nut is manually =
adjustable, I wish the lower (standard) nut was too.

Couple of issues.=20

Anyone else had failure of Schwable tyre. Mine - the casing was ****ed =
after approx a month or 300 miles riding!!! Its on its way back. Pretty =
annoying as I decided to sacrifice out and out speed of Primos for =
longevity etc. Also had a puncture prob a thorn from freshly cut =
hawthorn hedge in South Lanarkshire. Otherwise no complaints about grip =
sluggish compared to Primos with Presta tubes.

Touring bag the pockets at back are coming unstitched at teh top and on =
one side it has torn the fabric. Anyone else experience similar fault. I =
certainly havenot abused siad bag - again only used a few times. Having =
said that it is certainly capacious, not tested its weather proofness =
yet

I'm at 1200 mi on my first set of schwalbs w/ 1 flat on the rear.  Better 
than the ralieghs and far better than the primos over similar mileage.  Rear 
looks like it has a way to go before replacement is necessary.

My Schwalbe achieved 5000 km on the rear wheel. There is still some tread visible. It got 4 punctures on this distance, which is far better then the Primos or Raleighs I rode before.

Only after 50 kilometers I discovered that the upper nut is manually
adjustable, I wish the lower (standard) nut was too.

If you mean the normal seat post clamping bolt, it is adjustable !

My Schwalbes have performed superbly. I have had them fitted since late last
year, and they have done around 900Km. Grip is good, and there is almost no
sign of wear. I had my first puncture (rear of course) on Saturday, caused
by a small piece of wire. I find the rolling resistance is very nearly as
good as the Primos, and they are now my preferred tyre in this size. I
haven't yet fitted the new Brompton tyre to try it, though I have a set
ready.

I fitted the new pump on my old T5, and had the chance to try it in anger
when I had the puncture. It works very well - smooth action, and no trouble
attaining reasonable pressure.

I also have one of the new touring bags, but I have to admit I haven't tried
it!

  Couple of issues.

  Anyone else had failure of Schwable tyre. Mine - the casing was ****ed
after approx a month or 300 miles riding!!! Its on its way back. Pretty
annoying as I decided to sacrifice out and out speed of Primos for longevity

South Lanarkshire. Otherwise no complaints about grip sluggish compared to
Primos with Presta tubes.

  Touring bag the pockets at back are coming unstitched at teh top and on

I recently found out that the rear triangle of the B. is not the best of places for a pump. When I had to use it I found that it had got so rusty that I actually needed a screwdriver and a hammer to get it out of the mountings.

I since bought a very good pump which I keep in my bag. No more pumps on the frame for me!

> Anyone else had failure of Schwable tyre. 

Channell reported two cases of thread separation in March and Thorsten
of Velodroom told me that some in the early batch of Schwalbes failed. 
They were all exchanged for free by the supplier.

I have found that a tyre liner formerly marketed as Wolber Tape
to be effective in preventing punctures from thorns and
glass.Together with Schwalbe Special Marathon HS 159 tyres giving
as near 100o/o protection as one can get on a solo cycle.
Like all good products sorry to say both seem to be no longer
obtainable.
Should anyone be aware of a supplies of Wolber Tape, which lasts
for years, and is suitable for other brands of tyres, please
advise colin_heidi@tandems.fsnet.co.uk  thanks a lot.
Colin Foster.

But according to the manual you should only tighten the normal seat post clamping bolt by something like 1/6th of a turn during the entire life of the bike. Excessive tightening will damage the frame.
I found that by keeping the seat post and the plastic sleeve inside the frame absolutely grease-free I can stop any sliding of the seatpost, even though the clamping bolt on my bike isn't very tight at all.

If you mean the normal seat post clamping bolt, it is adjustable !

Subject: RE: new pump


I recently found out that the rear triangle of the B. is not the best of
places for a pump. When I had to use it I found that it had got so rusty
that I actually needed a screwdriver and a hammer to get it out of the
mountings.

I since bought a very good pump which I keep in my bag. No more pumps on the
frame for me!

Erwin de Vries

I wasn't in the habit of having a mounted pump until I fitted an Airzound2.
A week after fitting the old style pump, I noticed it had rusted on the
pump-rod.
Pump-rod now oiled, no further rusting.

It was one of the things I wrote to Brompton about. Another was the rusting
of the frame tube the seat post slides up and down in. I haven't found a
satisfactory solution to that as oil makes the seat post sink !

Mike.

I'm under the impression I read in the manual that it should be adjusted to
suit the weight and strenth of the rider.

I can't imagine how it would damage the frame, the only damage I foresee
would be to the clamping bolt itself - unless it was clamped without the
seat post in at all.

"manually", is here implied to mean: "without tools". And the new seat post
was (apparently) a few microns thinner than the old one so the lower nut had
to have its quarter turn.

If I tighten my seatpin at full extension it is much less tight than if the
post is set lower - for a shorter rider - rather irritating as its quite
stiff for the shorter rider.

No the post hasn't been squashed it was like that from new. I am not a B
novice.

I think that this may be caused by the flange at the lower end of the seatpost.
When the seatpost is fully raised the wider bit at the bottom of the seatpost partly enters the plastic sleeve which grips the seatpost.
The narrower bit above the flange is then not gripped as tightly, so the plastic sleeve has to hold on to a smaller bit of seatpost.
The solution could be to raise the saddle to slightly less than the max. height (you can see on the seatpost where it starts to widen, approx.  cm from the bottom) for the taller rider and adjust the clamping bolt accordingly.

If I tighten my seatpin at full extension it is much less tight than if the
post is set lower - for a shorter rider - rather irritating as its quite
stiff for the shorter rider.

No the post hasn't been squashed it was like that from new. I am not a B
novice.

But according to the manual you should only tighten the normal seat post
clamping bolt by something like 1/6th of a turn during the entire life of
the bike. Excessive tightening will damage the frame.
I found that by keeping the seat post and the plastic sleeve inside the
frame absolutely grease-free I can stop any sliding of the seatpost, even
though the clamping bolt on my bike isn't very tight at all.

Only after 50 kilometers I discovered that the upper nut is manually
adjustable, I wish the lower (standard) nut was too.

If you mean the normal seat post clamping bolt, it is adjustable !

90 PSI is about 6.2 bar, but beware of petrol station air pumps; pressure indicators may not function properly; carry a decent pressure gauge.
I suppose your B. doesn't have the Raleigh Record tyres, because 90 PSI will be too much for them. I never go beyond 70-75 PSI.

90 PSI is about 6.2 bar, but beware of petrol station air pumps; pressure
indicators may not function properly; carry a decent pressure gauge.

I'd find it hard to believe that any cyclist's pressure gauges are any
better than ones at petrol stations. In the UK, Trading Standards not only
check petrol pumps for delivering to specification but also forecourt air
gauges. I'm not sure of the tolerance on the air gauges as far as Trading
Standards go, but I bet it'll be nearer than you think. Check with the local
TS - and if you find a gauge you think to be in error at a garage, report it
to TS, they will go and check it and probably report back to you if you want
them to. That also costs nothing - just another Council Tax service !

Mike.

Greetings all:  I have finally more or less finished my
bike trailer pages and wanted to post the URL fya.

[that's "for your amusement" btw, not f'ya as in some kind
 of bizarre Amurrican-speak]

http://www.ucolick.org/~de/AltTrans/trailers.html

I would like to review a Blue Sky model also, but can't 
afford to go out and buy one just to review at present.
If anyone else has trailer reviews or specs to which I
should publish links, let me know.  At present my all-round
recommendation is the Winthers Donkey.  It's a winner.

Let me know about typos, obfuscations, etc.

Hi all

Thanks to you all for getting back to me with web site, etc. for Len's
ultimate folder.

Next is there any other gear options for the brompton. Would prefer 21speed
or above but with minimum of 14speed.
I live in a very hilly area and would require a low gear for climbing and a
fairly high gear for the down hill or flat. Have any of you tried a bike
with these options and how good was it. Were there any problem encountered.
Len's bike sounds ideal but will have to wait for costs etc. Can't under
stand why we Brits prefer these heavy hub gears. 
Iam not sure if brompton supply just part bikes so I could upgrade with gear
options or Len's rear triangle etc. 

Gavin............... from Aberdeen Scotland again. Questions, questions

maybe because they are (more) waterproof?  

I noticed lately that hub gears seem to be making 
something of a comeback over here in the US ...

Gavin, You could install a triple chain ring on front and then a Swiss
Mountain Drive.  You would have 30 gears then.  Enough? Or you could install
a 14 speed Rohloff hub with three chain rings in front. Let' s see, --that's
42 gears so far.  Now add the Mountain Drive to double it to 84 gear speeds.
Enough?  Well we should be getting there by now anyway!  And to think of the
joy I used to have on my old CCM one speed coaster brake machine. How
missguided I was then!  c

Can you imagine buying a car that you could only shift while it is moving?  I
really dislike derailleurs for that reason too.  As well as complicated shifting
patterns, short chain life, poor durability, high maintenance.  But they are
cheaper to mass produce, and may have some advantages for racing.  But I'm a
commuter.

My ten speed Brompton (with Mountain drive) has a wider range and lower gears
than you will probably ever find on any derailleur bike, even with 27 speeds.

To Valerie from Macromedia

It appears your company doesn't permit incoming email to their
employees!  when I tried to reply to your offlist email, I
got a weird bounce from macromedia more or less slapping my
wrist.

Anyway, glad you like the trailer pages and I will look
for references to the trailer you mention using with
your B.  Got a URL?

The obvious choice for a bike primarily designed for town use.

Suddenly need to stop at traffic lights, or for some other reason? No 
problem, change gear while stationary to one suitable for starting off.

They are also largely maintenance free. Transport cyclists want to 
use their machine to get from A to B, not fiddle with it.

There are also less oily parts to get on ones trousers.

The generally excellent Birdy has to be folded up in the highest 
gear, otherwise the chain comes off. Fine for a leisure bike, but not 
for someone folding the bike several times a day.

Someone suggested to me to twist the user-unfriendliness of the
derailleur into an advantage: theft prevention. When you leave a
derailleur bicycle somewhere in sight, leave it in highest gear, so it
leaves you plenty of time to catch the thief.  My humble opinion thinks
a frame lock is quicker and more effective.

Schwable tyres recently had thumbs up from the list. I had a failure after
around 300miles ( some of the early models suufered from this I ve been
informed) and a thorn puncture. They roll less well but small rice to pay
for peace of mind. They are only approx 50gms heavier good grip reflective
side walls. Martin Whitfield cycled 100o miles along urban battlefield adn
only had 1 puncture compared to average 8 he used to get with Primos or
Records.

They're not too pricey either.

I find I accidentally wheelie the Brompton T5 in second gear when pulling
away from lights. Can't really think there's a need for anything lower than
the standard bottom gear.

Is it that people just hate getting off and pushing when the legs give way ?

Gear selection while stationary, less maintenance, less annoying rattles,
fixed chain length (exc. Bromton !), reliability, no chain abuse, a pleasure
to use,...

Why not get one then you can stop imagining them ? DAF and Volvo make them

The only reason for so many gears is surely just so you can fiddle with them
?

Just imagine in town changing a gear every half turn of the crank... up...
then down again !

I used to leave my racer in top for that reason, before I bought a lock.

The day after a Brompton was fitted to my rear wheel, I nearly came off it

Yes, but...
When I was living in the UK I found that petrol station air pumps
deliver only about 60 psi. Some kind of 'pressure limiter' comes in to
prevent motorists causing spectacular explosions on the forecourt. It's
a safety feature for car drivers that read their manual upside down. You
only find that out *after* you've paid 10p for using the pump.

90 PSI is about 6.2 bar, but beware of petrol station air pumps;
pressure
indicators may not function properly; carry a decent pressure gauge.

I'd find it hard to believe that any cyclist's pressure gauges are any
better than ones at petrol stations. In the UK, Trading Standards not
only
check petrol pumps for delivering to specification but also forecourt
air
gauges. I'm not sure of the tolerance on the air gauges as far as
Trading
Standards go, but I bet it'll be nearer than you think. Check with the
local
TS - and if you find a gauge you think to be in error at a garage,
report it
to TS, they will go and check it and probably report back to you if you
want
them to. That also costs nothing - just another Council Tax service !

David,

    All this requires is to remember to shift to high on the derailleur when
coming to your destination where you intend to fold.  Not too hard to
remember, but if you forget you simply raise the rear wheel slightly and
make the shift while standing next to the bike.  On a comparison between the
Birdy and Brompton I personally don't think this "feature" of the Birdy is
overly relevant.

        Bob

Doesn't this involve one hand to lift, one hand to shift and another one
to turn the pedals?  A 50% increase compared to Bromptons?  Or is there
a trick?

Perhaps not better, jsut consistent from station to station.

And this is true too often in the States.  Rarely -- even in a bike shop -- 
does it get over 80 psi.  In an emergency, its worth a bet of $0.25 to see 
how high it will pump.  After that, its the "hand-held", then home.

ps: my Crank Brothers Power Pump fits in the cover bag, and does a passable 
job.

And then to stat off in high when starting off, or to lift the rear wheel 
up and change gear again. Fine for the occasionally folded leisure 
bike, not so good for one that is folded several times a day.

It depends what one is doing with the bike.

I'd never use those unless I was really desparate. I've even parked at one
and got an electric pump out of the car boot and used it on the forecourt in
defiance !

I think they're soft in the USA as air tools seem to be rated for 90psi. It
doesn't stop us running them on 150 psi. And FYI, the difference between 140
and 150 psi can sometimes be the difference between removing a nut or not.

You mean, as opposed to spinning up a hill?  Yes.   I can still do 3-4 MPH 
spinning as opposed to 2 MPH pushing.  

But, bottom line, I want to save my knees.

I've got about 1100 miles on my tires and they've just about had it.
Very good tires I must say.

I'm with David on this one - it is often these small things that end up
really mattering over the long term.  Magazine tests of bikes, cars, hi fi,
you name it, often make a big point about features, performance and so on
but usually miss out an evaluation of what something is actually like to
live with.  The hard-to-measure livability usually determines whether a
device is still in regular use years after it was bought.  On that basis my
Brompton and my Palm Pilot are two of the best devices around!

yr modifications of the winthers' donkey hitch are so impressive; makes me want to ask you how you would go about attaching one to a Brompton.

When I stop riding, I'm basically standing on the pedal on the side I
get off, so it is very much pushed down already. But let's assume you
have an equally efficient way to get off a bicycle with the pedal up. 
Can you shift four, five gears in one pedal stroke??  That's definitely
not my experience, although I only had mediocre derailleurs.  So it
meant pulling the pedal.  Perhaps with pedal straps make it enjoyable?

well I'll have to think about that.  the big challenge is 
of course that any B hitch either has to be quickly
removable, or it has to permit folding the bike w/o
interference.  I will stare at my B and see if I can
come up with something.  maybe stein would like to
contribute an idea or two.

It's a lot easier to just move the lever on a hub geared bike.

One has to ease off the pressure, just like a derailleur equipped bike.

Modern hub gears don't have any oil to leak. The old ones did have 
oil and on mine it stayed inside. Far cleaner than a derailleur.

Jane Thomas' pages have instructions on at least the older hubs.

An appreciable amount. However 3 or 5 speeds are more than 
adequate for the Brompton's intended use.

Precisely the point I have made a number of times.

OO, how weird ! Not you, but that method.

On stopping, I take one foot off the pedals to stop everything falling over
on stopping. This means that I have one foot on the ground, one bum on the
saddle and the other foot on the other pedal - so it's the one that's down.
This is actually handy if parking the bike at the kerb as the upper pedal is
in the right position to go over the kerb and with a slight bacward rotation
assumes the correct position for holding the bike up.

But let's assume you

I'd say more efficient :)

> Can you shift four, five gears in one pedal stroke??

Easy on a brompton ;)

Just about possible with derailleurs.

Perhaps you are not a regular around a city centre's racing circuit where
conditions change totally with very little notice.

By now the lights been green and gone back to red.

A friction lever will change derailleurs under load, a mechanical insult to
a chain, I've found indexed gears VERY reluctant to change under load, so
still requiring an easing of foot pressure.

Is it from the hub or from the fact that hubs are used in shittier rides on
the streets ?

I'm on a 5 speed hub. A year and a half down the road hasn't shown signs of
any problems.

Furthermore

Do any bike shops have a clue about hub gears anyway ?

Hmmm, I'd soak mine in hot grease like the cassette. It would then be
greased for life.

My Dad rode SA hubs. He said they never failed him and the only service they
got was new pawl springs - and that was only because the hub had stopped
clicking !

I do not know why people make such a big deal about not being able to change
gears without moving.  If you are in to big a gear at say a stop light, so
what.  It's no big deal to lift the rear frame and pedal in place to change
gears.   I can't say that happens many times for me.  Birdy owners can argue
that you have to remember to put it in 5th before folding.  At least with
their err they get immediate feedback.  How about changing gears while going
up a hill?  The last thing I want to do is stop pedaling and lose any little
momentum I already have to do so.

Bicycles with derailleur do have their advantages.  For one they are much
cleaner.  The SA hub does leak oil/grease which then attracts dirt to the
surrounding spokes.   My hand do not get quite as dirty changing a flat on a
derailleur equipped bike.  As for getting a flat tire, a quick release lever
for the hub (as well as the brake too) is a nice advantage.  Derailleur
bikes do require and adjustment from time to time just like the SA.

I have not found out for myself yet, but I would imagine the SA hub requires
servicing or at least some maintenance after 5,000 miles or so.  I can get
twice or thrice that mileage before replacing the sprockets on a derailleur
bike.  It is a simple swap in/swap out.  I wouldn't want to begin to figure
out how to service an internal geared hub on my own.  So there is a 14 speed
internal hub geared bike.  All else equal, a 3sp SA hub is more reliable
than a 5sp SA hub.  How reliable is a 14 sp hub going to be?  Furthermore
what bike shop is going to service it correctly or has even seen one before?
SA is a quality geared hub, so comparing it to a department store bike is
not a fair one at that.  A quality derailleur bike is very reliable.  Common
folk like myself ride the same equipment they use in the Tour De France.

How much heavier is a 14sp hub than a derailleur equipped bike?
Additionally, the spacing/jump between gears is still greater with the 14sp
hub.  Changing gearing ratios (swapping cassette and chain ring sizes) is
much easier and much more customized with a derailleur equipped bike, too.

Chains last longer on internal hub geared bike- I do not think so.  In
theory it should but in practice I have found it not to be the case.  The
reason being single speed, cruiser bike chains tend to be of lesser quality.
The Sachs chain that comes with the B is of good quality, but still does not
compare to the Sachs/SRAM chain on my 9 speed derailleur bike.  I can easily
swap in/swap out the chain using the Sachs powerlink.  While chain A is on
the bike chain B is soaking in degreaser.  Much more convenient and a job
better done than cleaning the chain while on the B.  I can get 6,000+ miles
out of each chain respectively before they need to be replaced.  I would
imagine the B chain and rear sprocket would long since be replaced (Maybe my
SA hub will need to be serviced then, too).

Well I could rant more, but I will stop here.  In the end, each type of
gearing has its advantages and its purpose.  I'll keep using my B for
city/around town riding and use my derailleur bike for longer,
touring/sporting rides.
Peter

Many of the pumps at "service stations" in CA/USA are purely of the 'pay for 
air' type; and these usually run v. low pressure (< 60-80psi max).  There is 
one gas station that has given me all I ask for -- has gone to 120 -- but 
these are the exception. 

Yesterday it had me looking at a compressor, or the nail-gun type.  But these 
run in the neighborhood of 90-120.  For that kind of money (~$250 US), I'd 
like the option of getting 170-200 psi, as I understand some racing tires 
require 160+.

If that is so, then why does my rear wheel accumulate so much dirt or gunk
after riding it for a 100 miles or so in dry weather?  There is a greasy
film coating which progresses up and away from the hub - running up the
spokes.  Looking at my rear wheel now, I see such build up on the non drive
side, too.  I use a very dry lube so it can't be too much throw off from the
chain.  A small wheel which revolves around many times more per mile than
other common bikes does not explain why my front wheel remains reasonably
clean for many miles.  (I have found this to be more of a problem with SA
than Shimano internal geared hubs.  I like the SA hub alot - this is my only
pet peeve with the product. It is a big enough deal because I use the B for
commuting to the office.)  So how is this far cleaner than a bicycle with a
derailleur?  Guess which bike I carry a set of latex gloves with?
:-)  -Peter

I have a red Brompton L-5 for sale, used but in very good condition. It has 
the original Saccon brake in the rear but has Channell's v-brake conversion 
in the front. It has the extended seatpost and folding pedal. I've added 
skate wheels but can give you the original coasters if you want. There are 
two Primo tires on the bike and I'll include a third brand new Primo. Also 
included -- two Raleigh Record tires, a spare rim and spokes for the rear 
wheel. A seatpost is included but not a saddle. I am asking $700 but will 
consider other offers.
I would prefer to sell to someone in the New York City area but will ship at 
the buyer's expense.

Not tried the Brompton tyre, but the Schwalbes I put on around 3 months
ago are excellent.  After nearly 1000 miles there is little sign of
tread wear, even on the rear.

There *is* a bit more rolling resistance compared with the Primo or even
the Record, but not enough to worry about and the advantage of being
able to cycle on just about any surface without worrying about punctures
(none so far, at least) outweighs just about everything else for me.

Grip seems fine, too.

I use the bike hod on a commuting moutain bike and find it very satisfactory
for shopping and books/papers (once panniers are full). It doesn't like
exceeding 20mph downhill with a load and pulses a bit.  However it is great
for sweeping through Birmingham's traffic filled ring roads.
I've never got around to fitting it to the Brompton although I have the
bigger clamp that is required for the seat post. Obviously you need low
gears for climbing and I've only got a standard L3. Supplier is 2 +2

The bikes used in this race are heavily pampered, just like racing 
cars are.

The person cycling around town does not have a team of mechanics 
looking at the bike every day. They need something that will work 
every day without too much attention.

I suggest you have the hub looked at. There shouldn't be a greasy 
film from it.

It's because the only way they know how to do it is awkward, takes more
time than it should, looks clumsy, makes ones trousers dirty.  Please
share your experience if you know otherwise.

I would love to have a derailleur system again.  The cooperation and
pleasant rattling of the different chainwheels, the openness and
simplicity of the system, the knowledge you can ride home somehow even
if it fails.  But such a drag to use and maintain.  All right,
maintenance is not much of an issue on a folder since the chain can't be
enclosed.  And true, the SA hub seems to leak a bit, albeit only enough
to make it look dirty without making dirty.  But sudden gear changing
sucks, and you need to unless the Tour de France has cleared the road
for you!  And it's not that hard to improve: an extra cable that unlocks
the freewheel is all I need.

I have a small compressor which is powered from the cigarette lighter socket
in a car. It goes up to 220psi and they seem common enough here.

Not tried the Brompton tyre, but the Schwalbes I put on around 3 months
ago are excellent.  After nearly 1000 miles there is little sign of
tread wear, even on the rear.

There *is* a bit more rolling resistance compared with the Primo or even
the Record, but not enough to worry about and the advantage of being
able to cycle on just about any surface without worrying about punctures
(none so far, at least) outweighs just about everything else for me.

Grip seems fine, too.

Absolutely no bother at all as easy as Primos kms better than Records. Still
I make sure bead is in middle of rim.

Well the experience I share with you may not be practical if you are
traveling to work in a nice pair or trousers.  I say this because it would
imply that you are wearing a nice pair of shoes to go with those trousers.
But, if you are to be wearing a pair of bike shoes with clipless
(clip/step-in pedals) it makes changing gears while stationary much easier.
Have one foot on the ground, one hand on the bars and the other slightly
lifting the rear of the bike - enough to have the rear tire clear the
ground.  With your other foot, pedal. It takes about one complete rotation,
maybe less to have the next gear engaged.  What makes this very possible is
the cleated pedal.  I would imagine it more awkward using toe straps and
more so with platform pedals.

The Tour de France reference I had made was intended towards a few folks
questioning the reliability of derailleur systems.  Granted these racers
ride whatever their sponsors provide them, but I have never heard any
accounts of derailleur failing in a ~2,500 mile race.  Those moving human
billboards ride the same equipment that is made for sale to the public.

>>unless the Tour de France has cleared the road
>>for you!
>From the accounts I read this year by some of the riders in the race, there
are too many press, VIP, sponsor cars/motorbikes in the race.  The operative
word here is *read*.  How I wish I had access to the Eurosport TV channel!

It's because the only way they know how to do it is awkward, takes more
time than it should, looks clumsy, makes ones trousers dirty.  Please
share your experience if you know otherwise.

I would love to have a derailleur system again.  The cooperation and
pleasant rattling of the different chainwheels, the openness and
simplicity of the system, the knowledge you can ride home somehow even
if it fails.  But such a drag to use and maintain.  All right,
maintenance is not much of an issue on a folder since the chain can't be
enclosed.  And true, the SA hub seems to leak a bit, albeit only enough
to make it look dirty without making dirty.  But sudden gear changing
sucks, and you need to unless the Tour de France has cleared the road
for you!  And it's not that hard to improve: an extra cable that unlocks
the freewheel is all I need.

Yes the hopeless scheduling of Channel 4's excellent coverage has driven me
to a digital box for Eurosport -6pounds per month well spent.  I replace
derailleur chains and rear sprockets every 2-3 years but the mechanisms are
pretty reliable and slick.

However my beloved Brompton is a different kettle of fish to the racing bike
and the three speed sturmey suits it very well and needs very little
maintenance. Yesterday, pottered to work in the rain along the bit of
Sustrans network in Birmingham, with a cape its like an enclosed module. On
the way back could potter under Five Ways junction (nightmare in a car at
rush hour) bought 32nd wedding anniversary bunch of flowers under the
subway, stuffed bunch stalk down into front pannier, along with sundry
papers, photos and selection of library books, florist used tape to hold it
onto top of pannier frame and then off clicking through the gears and not
turning handlebar too much (would have crushed the lilies) along canal
towpath and home, just in time to see Pantani and Armstrong on the Ventoux.
I still find the Brompton original spec. - all of piece and fit for purpose.
I took all day to do 20 miles with a days work (meetings, emails and word
processing) in between. In the Tour they were exceeding 20 miles each hour
up one of the most challenging roads in cycling, for that Super Record and
Durace no doubt helps but probably there's some nutter whose done the Etape
du Stage on a fixed with a Carradice saddle bag !

Well the experience I share with you may not be practical if you are
traveling to work in a nice pair or trousers.  I say this because it would
imply that you are wearing a nice pair of shoes to go with those trousers.
But, if you are to be wearing a pair of bike shoes with clipless
(clip/step-in pedals) it makes changing gears while stationary much easier.
Have one foot on the ground, one hand on the bars and the other slightly
lifting the rear of the bike - enough to have the rear tire clear the
ground.  With your other foot, pedal. It takes about one complete rotation,
maybe less to have the next gear engaged.  What makes this very possible is
the cleated pedal.  I would imagine it more awkward using toe straps and
more so with platform pedals.

The Tour de France reference I had made was intended towards a few folks
questioning the reliability of derailleur systems.  Granted these racers
ride whatever their sponsors provide them, but I have never heard any
accounts of derailleur failing in a ~2,500 mile race.  Those moving human
billboards ride the same equipment that is made for sale to the public.

are too many press, VIP, sponsor cars/motorbikes in the race.  The operative

It's because the only way they know how to do it is awkward, takes more
time than it should, looks clumsy, makes ones trousers dirty.  Please
share your experience if you know otherwise.

I would love to have a derailleur system again.  The cooperation and
pleasant rattling of the different chainwheels, the openness and
simplicity of the system, the knowledge you can ride home somehow even
if it fails.  But such a drag to use and maintain.  All right,
maintenance is not much of an issue on a folder since the chain can't be
enclosed.  And true, the SA hub seems to leak a bit, albeit only enough
to make it look dirty without making dirty.  But sudden gear changing
sucks, and you need to unless the Tour de France has cleared the road
for you!  And it's not that hard to improve: an extra cable that unlocks
the freewheel is all I need.

My favourite and most reliable Brompton has 1 gear, and my favourite standard 
bike has one gear and one brake.

It saves a considerable amount of effort in keeping the things servicable, 
and makes little or no difference to the performance.  I do also chuckle when 
I find that briskly walking up hill with the f/w bike on steeper climbs, 
makes a nice change from riding, and I walk past the macho crowd, legs 
spinning and grinning stupidly because they haven't needed to get off the 
bike.

3 gears is plenty - but the ratios in the AW are rubbish - bring back the 
original selection of ranges in different models!

PS Confessions - I was 28 before I rode a bike with wheels smaller than 26"

I have heard that significant reductions in maintenance
cost can be achieved by eliminating the drivetrain and
connecting the pedal assembly directly to a large front
wheel, with a much smaller rear wheel to assist the
rider in balancing the machine...  there are, however,
some trade-offs in rider comfort and safety.

;->

no, but seriously, I often feel that these 24-speed things
I often ride are a bit silly for 'round town.  One usually
ends up using them as a 7 speed on the middle chainring,
at least I do.  I think my B could do with, not more gears,
but a slightly wider spread.  Probably hard to achieve
w/a hub.  I covet a Mt Drive, but can't justify it because
the B is not my daily commute bike... my ideal B, besides
being the superlight model that I will never be able to
afford :-) would have 7 speeds very similar to the middle
chainring range on my MTB.

Interesting, I hear of people saying the gearing is too wide. Personally I
like it, but want 6th gear !

If your really interested in purchasing an excellent bike, i'll be glad to 
answer any questions. It's not a sale, as you know folders are not a high 
volume commodity so manufacturers tend to sell way above normal profit 
margins.

The one thing that I hate the most about derailleur bikes, and don't deny it, it
happens to you too:  The chain falls off.  At least every few hundred miles,
usually on the front and at the worst time because I tried to shift too fast or
do something else stupid.  But no one would ever put up with performance like
that in a car, no one should have to in a bike.  We have a God given right to be
stupid and I don't need my bike calling attention to the fact, I can do it
myself.

I don't care much about weight, etc.  I care about reliability, flexibility
(which is why I have a Brompton) comfort (which is why I only ride recumbents)
and being outside.  And yes, convenience.  I wonder what kind of car you drive,
does it have manual turn signals that you blink by hand and a windshield washer
that you pump with your foot?  Probably not.  I have tons of gadgets on my bike
too, just like the car.  If I could get wind speed and direction, I would buy
it.  Don't you think an anemometer on my helmet would look cool?  But I hate it
when a chain falls off.

And yes, I really like being able to shift whenever I feel like it.  Call me
vain!  Peter, I don't know where you are from (few of us ever signs even what
country we are from, why is that?) but I'm guessing it is not so hilly?  Of
course you are very experienced.  But in the places where you only ever use the
very highest and the very lowest gears, it can be very common to see at least
the less experienced riders stall out on derailleurs when a steep downhill turns
into a sudden uphill.  It can be hard to restart.

He meant using lower gears to save his knees.  Ever tried walking a bike with a
heavy trailer up a 15% grade?  Poor ergonomics, much better to have low gears
and stay in the saddle

In the old days a leather strap with a reflector was optionally fitted around a
Sturmey hub and picked up the light film that migrates out the bearings.  I have
even seen a short piece of rope do well at this.  Of course a freewheel picks up
gunk too.

Now really, when are we going to see a shaft drive bike?  This is the year 2000
after all.  The future is here, why do we still use chains at all?  Talk about
gunk.  We need more Bike R&D, less micro chip R&D.  And when is Janet Reno gonna
break up Shimano? Huh?

Take a look at the thread and you will see people saying that hub 
gears need less maintenance. I suggest that the people doing so 
probably have experience of both sorts of gear and are able to 
compare both under likely use. I forget the last time I adjusted the 
hub gears on my Brompton, they just work. That's not the same with 
other bikes that have derailleur gears.

I don't recall anyone saying that derailleur gears are unreliable.

Anyone who says that either (or no) sort of gearing is "best" is 
probably not that experienced in the variations. Either and no 
gearing system has strengths and weaknesses. It's like those who 
think there is a "best" bike, it all depends what one wants to do with it.

Around the year 1900 there was a shaft driven bike. This implies the use of
two sets of these conical gears which are not as efficient as a chain. On a
Brompton it would also imply a rather complicated part to make it foldable.

Are Robert and Peter thinking of their Bromptons or their other bikes ? 
Doesn't lifting the seat of a B leave the back wheel in contact with the 
ground? Is it really possible to lift the low back wheel of a B with one 
hand, to shift gears with the other hand, and to pedal in that position to 
change gears without getting off the bike? (I had a great time trying this, btw.)

The opinions expressed on this thread are quite passionate, and I am not taking sides with either camp, just curious about how those with derailleur equipped Brompton's deal with what is quite easy to accomplish on a regular bike.

No. The point where it folds would need an axle with bevel gear. A short
shaft from the crank to this point, then another shaft to the rear wheel.

Don't knees wear out faster the more they're used ?

I also enjoy playing with the hub. Changing 2-3 and 4-5 won't happen with a
load on. I'll select 3 or 5 and keep pedalling, it'll change when it's ready

I have found I can pick the Brompton up with one hand while maintaining it's
unfolded state. Pick it up by the front of the rear carrier while wedging
the saddle up the armpit !

Mmmm, well, my junker MTB has served me for 12 years around town
in a coastal climate, is left out in the rain while I shop or
catch a bus someplace else, carries heavy loads, hauls a trailer,
and climbs small but steep hills every time I go downtown and
return... it has been in mud, and it's been swamped by white
water from waves breaking over our 20-ft coastal cliffs in
the winter storms.  And I've never had the chain come off.

This is a cheap offshore bike folks, the kind you get from
a liquidator's catalog.  I use it around town because it
is less likely to get stolen than a good bike.

I've never had the chain break.  And I've done almost zero
maintenance on the bike -- think I clean the chain and re-oil
it about once every 5 years, and one time I splurged and let
a shop tune it up -- that was when it was about 10 years old.

I'm not sure why folks think derailleurs are unreliable.  They
are a nuisance to tune up, but I think that bike proves that
you can ride one for years, completely abuse it, and yet still
have a working bike...  and I do shift it under drive, crash
the gears, etc.  I have never thought of derailleurs as
anything but bread-n-butter tech, stuff you hardly ever
have to think about.

Dear Morton,

    The "Lift seat (one hand), shift (other hand), push pedal (one foot)..."
was referring to a Birdy Folder, not a Brompton.  I don't own a Brompton
(but find this list very enjoyable and informative).  One of my Birdys (I
have 3) has a seven speed derailleur PLUS a 3 speed hub, best of both
worlds.  If you put the derailleur in high (required so chain has maximum
flex length for folding AND put the hub gear in low, it doesn't matter that
the derailleur is in high when starting off, unless you are beginning with a
monster hill.

        Bob

Well, you didn't actually get off the bike in your description; I got my
bumm and other foot off before I stopped.

But I'm a bit puzzled here. I picture a poor lonely bike left somewhere
in a street, on the edge of the car lane, not locked to any object, in
fear of a gust of wind, drivers who want to park there, people crossing
and thieves. You just cannot be so cruel, so I must be wrong. 
Obviously, you were still sitting on the bike.  It all makes sense now!

It appears to be clear that pedaling quickly (>80rpm) with light force is far
less wearing on the knees than using greater force at lower speeds.  I'm not a
doctor but maybe someone else knows if there is any truth to the idea that
there may actually be some benefit to the knees from proper cycling.

Truly, you have never had a derailleur slip or the chain come off?  You are lucky
my friend.  Just today I was riding with a coworker (both of us on derailleurs I
admit!) and as we pushed hard up a hill she shifted and the rear gear jumped.
She was off the saddle and came down hard on a tender part.  The bike was a Trek,
middle price range, fairly new and well adjusted.

What seems to have escaped this entire discussion is that hub gears have an
obvious engineering advantage for small wheeled bikes such as most folders:  It
is difficult to get a reasonably high gear on a 16 inch wheel, it requires
something like a 75 tooth gear in front.  A planetary gear offers something
approaching a 50% increase in the high gear which makes a 50 tooth front chain
ring quite reasonable.

Back to shaft drive bike of the future: Of course that will be a front wheel
drive recumbent, don't you think?  And perhaps it will fold into a smallish
briefcase.  With a total gear range of nine to one at least and full fairings.  I
want to see this as a national research priority in the presidential election.

Why stand around when you can sit ?
Actually, I get off just before turning the pedals so the top one rests on
the kerb.

Perhaps you don't remember 50 years ago ?
I don't think cars were locked, never mind bikes !

I've not seen mention yet of finding neutral with a hub gear. I've only
found it:

1. when the adjustment came loose and allowed the control cable to lengthen
2. After the bikes been in the LBS, where the same thing happened the day
after
3. On the LBS' borrowed bike,

And I've heard the LBS' manager coming off when he found neutral while
unseated. If only he'd learn to set the cables properly !

My previous bike had derraileurs. The front was never a problem, the back
got the gears and wasn't a problem, they weren't indexed. The problem was
the chain jumped on the two smallest sprockets. I _eventually_ tracked it
down to a weak spring in the derraileur.

I have borrowed a newish friend's bike with indexed gears. These I've found
to do peculiar things like not change or two change 2 gears at a time in
certain places.

I know where I am with a hub ;)

And if you take the chain off, lean against a wall and pedal like buggery
for half an hour, you'll end up knackerd and won't have got anywhere. Any
mech eng geezer would tell you that having unbalanced masses moving around
is a waste of energy so minimising this is a saving.

The "Chain fallig off derralieur" scenario has certainally happened to me,
but so has the "Chain falling off Brompton" one.   Am I alone?

Not exactly, mine once came derailed from the tensioner wheel but didn't
come off completely.

The "Chain fallig off derralieur" scenario has certainally happened to me, but so has the "Chain falling off Brompton" one.   Am I alone?

Somehow my chain went for a wander into the chain tensioner and locked everything up whilst i was cycling along the Speyside Way.  Fortunately it was the work of an instant to flip the back wheel under and unjam the mechanism.

Still can't work out why it happened: reasonably smooth surface and well maintained chain.  It's not happened again, so I'm not losing any sleep over it.

Set up a filter to reject any messages with "Extra gears" in the title 
and you don't have to see any more messages on it. Then those 
who are interested can carry on without boring you. We will also 
avoid top posted messages where there is one line of posting and 
dozens of lines of quoted text.

The only time the chain falls off on my derailleur bike is when I fall off
the bike.  :-)  I think the reason I do not experience "drop chain" syndrome
is that I changed my outer chain ring to a 50 from a 53; so my chain line is
real tight and shifting between rings is much smoother.  (When I had the 53,
I rarely used it)  Yes, I have seen many drop chains.  Their is a product
available to prevent such.  I can't recall the name, but people I know who
use it, swear by it.  The best description I can give for it is a small
plastic item that attaches to the seat tube, near the bottom bracket and
serves like a guard rail.  -Peter

The one thing that I hate the most about derailleur bikes, and don't deny
it, it
happens to you too:  The chain falls off.  At least every few hundred miles,
usually on the front and at the worst time because I tried to shift too fast
or
do something else stupid.  But no one would ever put up with performance
like
that in a car, no one should have to in a bike.  We have a God given right
to be
stupid and I don't need my bike calling attention to the fact, I can do it
myself.

Hi!
I am interested in purchasing one of your bikes, but was unclear as to the 
price. You mention $1500 to reserve a bike in the first run, but give no 
estimate as to what the final price will be. Please advise.

Since this response didn't quite answer the question, let me add me 
experience.  

Having had problems with both knees and back, but NOT being a physician, it 
has been indicated to me -- and tests out well -- that doing nothing is not 
always the best alternative.  Of course over-exertion, or "knaackering" 
(getting knackered up?), leads to its own problems [I'll get the knack].  
Gentle motion -- thru the range, without incurring unnecessary pain -- has 
helped me to be able to extend that range back to normal and not be subject 
to pain; thus I've found it v restorative and recuperative.

Walking has recently helped me thru some back problems, at least of a 
muscular nature, and to some extent gentle cycling,  And so too, as with the 
knee problems, gentle use seems to have a way of "working things out."  It 
also is reassuring to the mind worried about further capabilities.

It's good to know that I can still be mobile, where the pain was too much to 
clutch, brake and drive.  AND, its so natural.
P.

Ps:  "boring" had occurred to me, too, David; but I don't have filters.

I know we're wandering off topic again here, but can't
resist an observation.  Not only do people get hurt in
cars, but the driving position in most cars seems very
hard on the whole knee-through-lower-back region.  how
many times I've got out of a rental car and ached
all over...

I know a friend who had neck injury from a minor auto
collision -- no deep disability but lasting pain and
nuisance.  She then started driving everywhere because
"it hurts to walk", and then having even more trouble
because of lack of exercise, etc.  What I'm fumblingly
trying to say is that the auto seems to be one of those
addictive drug-type things, which can damage you in
such a way that you then feel even more dependent on it
and use it more, hence damaging yourself more, etc.

not very well expressed, sorry, but am dashing this
off when I should be working.

I find that cycling can help with knee pain to some extent. I have no
medical qualification so take the following with a pinch of salt.

The knee has some muscular support around it, cycling can strengthen these
muscles which helps remove some of the stress on the knee's load-bearing
surfaces. Cycling at a high tempo. helps strengthen these muscles more than
cycling at low tempo.

Comparing walking/running to cycling: cycling involves articulating the knee
joint with a load less than one's body weight on it. This has to be a good
thing vs. walking where the full body weight is supported, and especially
vs. running where there is an impact at each step. The pedalling motion
involves a much smoother application of force. Again, higher tempo. is
preferred here because you can exert the same power with more power-strokes
of less force.

If anyone has references to more authoritative medical information, I'd be
interested in seeing them.

Toby

Dear Bromptoneers,

Contrarily to what I had promised, unfortunately I did not have the time to
prepare a thorough analyis of the results of the survey on folding bicycle
usage for the Velo Mondial conference. In my paper I only examined some
data combinations that underlined the points that I wanted to make. You can
read it at the following address:

http://www.protrade.matav.hu/survey.rtf

By the way, thank you for all the respondents from the list so far.

The real analysis is still ahead of me. I will be on holidays now, so I
will do it in August. Some people kept sending in filled-in questionnaires
even after the deadline was way behind, I have some additional material to
work on. So I thought I would officially reopen the survey for those who
are new to it or have not had the time to fill it, all this until August
5th when hopefully I will be back and working on analysing the final results.

The address is:

Best regards to all:

Andras Toth

Listening to your own body is also good for you.

Greetings SF Bay area folderistas

The San Francisco Chronicle is hosting a 33 mile tour (with shortcuts) on
Sunday, August 6, 2000.  It starts and finishs at Sequoia High School in
Redwood City (@Broadway & El Camino), which is south of SF in San Mateo
County.

The theme: "No pain, no pain".  

Registration is $25 adults, $15 for kids, $5 more on ride day.  Four rest
stops, shuttle support, pre and post-ride party.

To register online, 

www.chronicleevents.com

Since the next SF Folder ride is not scheduled until October, and the
weather has been quite wonderful lately, how about a show of force from the
little wheeled masses?

Hi all,
sorry for not answering the mails that some of you wrote as an answer to my 
enquiry. The day after my mail I had a rather hefty accident (some friendly 
bloke in a van turned left and oversaw me. Result: brand-new L5 destroyed, 4 
stiches on the left eyebrow, 6 on the top of my head).
The time I had to spend off work resulted in a little overwork that made 
e-mailing a little difficult.
But now I'm back and I will write individually to all the nice people who 
answered my mail soon!

Regards

So white van syndrome is international, we need to ensure that the van
owner's firm is boycotted by all bikers from Bromptonites to Hells Angels.

Yes,  sounds like a lovely excuse to ride the Caltrain:

for a short ride to the school:

Howdy all!

I own a Brompton T5, purchased before Christmas so this is not the
newest model.  Instead, it's the older model with the not-so-good brakes,
but the brakes work fine for me for what I need.

These brakes, however, are set up so that the brake cable enters from
the bottom and not from the top.  When I tighten the brakes by turning the 
adjustment screw by the calipers, I notice that after a while the adjustment
screw screws back in to the calipers on its own and loosens the brakes again.  
There's that little nut on the adustment screw that I turn, and I position
the nut so it's right up against the caliper arm, theoretically stopping
the adjustment screw from turning.  However, the nut is loose and gravity (and 
vibrations) allow the nut to turn and fall out of the way, allowing the
adjustment screw to screw itself back into the caliper arm, thus loosening
the brakes.

(Do I make any sense here?)

Has anyone else had this problem?  Is there an easy way to keep my
brake calipers adjusted to the proper tension?  To keep that nut from falling?
To keep the adjustment screw from turning?

Did anyone have problems upgrading to the new brakes
on a T5?

I got the front brake on but the the screw that goes
through the fork was barely long enough to attach a
nut to.  The nut is hanging on only a few threads.  It
has held so far but I'd rather have it fastened more
sucurely.  Did I do anything wrong?

You're doing the right thing, just not getting the locknut tight enough IMO.

Maybe you put the rear brake on the front.  The front brake has a longer
bolt.c

use a spanner or pliers(depending on your mechanical sympathy!) to tighten
the lock nut...this will lock the barrel of the adjuster...problem solved!

Robert,
I just checked the converted brakes on my T5 from 97, Nr 143458. Plenty of
thread left.  Are you shure the washers sit properly?

Ok, a nice juicy technical question for which all opinions are most welcome.

I currently have a T5 with a front changer: chainrings 53 and 39, with a 14
tooth sprocket.  By my reckoning that gives the following gear inches:

93.7 (large ring, 5th)
79.1 (large, 4th)
68.9 (small, 5th)
62.5 (large, 3rd)
58.2 (small, 4th)
49.9 (large, 2nd)
46.0 (small, 3rd)
41.6 (large, 1st)
36.7 (small, 2nd)
30.6 (small, 1st)

Mostly this works pretty well but I do have two problems:

1) 93.7" is a bit too low in many situations I encounter every day.  I run
out of spin at about 33 mph in places where I could easily wring a few more
knots out of the beast with a higher gear.

2) 30.6 isn't quite low enough for going back up some of the hill to which
(1) applies!

There is also more overlap in this set up than I like - yes it reduces the
gaps between gears but at the expense of a complicated shift pattern.  In
practice I tend to use the small ring only for steep climbs which means I am
only really getting two extra gears (7 speed rather than 10).

I am looking at the Mountain Drive and this is the nub of my question: which
type to get, the type 1 reduction or type 2 increase gearing.

The two options work out like this:

Type 1 (reduction) with 54 tooth ring and 13 tooth sprocket.

102.8, 86.8, 68.5, 54.8, 45.7, 41.1, 34.7, 27.4, 21.9 and 18.3 
with no overlaps (i.e. pure "range change" gearbox).

Type 2 (increase) with 33 tooth ring and 14 tooth sprocket.

96.3 (high, 5th)
81.2 (high, 4th)
64.2 (high, 3rd)
58.3 (direct, 5th)
51.3 (high, 2nd)
49.4 (direct,4th)
42.8 (high, 1st)
38.9 (direct, 3rd)
31.1 (direct, 2nd)
25.9 (direct 1st)

Advantages of the Type 1

Widest possible range 102.8 to 18.3 should cope with anything.

Disadvantages of Type 1

54 tooth ring is pretty big
13 tooth sprocket much less long-lifed than 14 tooth in my experience (and
retaining 14 tooth sprocket means using  a 57 or 58 tooth ring if such a
thing exists).
Range change occurs between 46" and 41" which is quite a critical range to
be fiddling about with a bottom bracket gear change.

Advantages of Type 2

Small (33 tooth) ring is neat, 14 tooth sprocket can be retained.
Direct drive used for low gears which means drive is most efficient when you
most need it.

Disadvantages of Type 2

Overall range not so good.
Some near duplicates in the overlapped portion of the range.


So what is the perceived wisdom of the world's Brompton riders?  I am sort
of tending towards the type 2 but then notice that this only raises top from
93.6 to 96.3 and lowers bottom from 30.6 to 25.9 which does not seem a huge
gain over my current set up.

best regards

Peter

I agree. A 13 tooth sprocket may have a shorter life (make sure you change
the chain at the same time, this is said to help with longevity) but it's
quite a bit less expensive than a mountain drive.

Simple and much less expensive solution?  How about switching to a 13 tooth
cog in the back. (DISCLAIMER: I have done no gear inch math for this reply)
You would get a higher "highest" gear and would get more use out of the
small ring I would reckon.

On the other hand, if a 30.6" is not low enough, this would concern me more
than 93.7" being too low.  Fast is fast enough, especially 33+ mph on a
Brompton.  My personal preference would be to have enough gearing for going
up hills than down them.

Taken in same way ... yes, the bike is just a tool, but it is a tool which I
use to commute 20 miles daily in hilly country so the question is genuine.

 But aren't some tools (like a loom or a lense) more than just spanner-
 like?  More than a means-to-end.  Doesn't a bicycle say something about
 humans?

  Subject: How much does it cost?


  While with the Brompton, I am frequently asked the question, "How much =
does
  it cost?" It is by far the most common question asked.  At first it =
was a
  bit humoring to see the incredulous expression on ones face when they =
find
  out it costs more than  say a couple of hundred dollars (or any =
bicycle for
  that).

  Frequency aside, I do mind it a bit when asked such by a stranger on =
the
  street.  "Bike jacking" is not such an uncommon thing here in NYC.  =
It's not
  the only thought that pops into my head when asked.  Your opinion may
  differ, but asking indiscriminately such a question to me is like =
asking
  "How much money do you have in your wallet?" Yes, I am aware, for most =
it is
  out of genuine curiosity, but it seems rather crude to ask.  When =
asked
  sometimes I will tell the true cost other times I will give a low ball
  figure.

  I am sure other have been asked such question.  I am curious to learn =
how
  other Brompton owners handle such situation.
  Would anyone like to share their pithy or witty comments?  Thanks in
  advance.  -Peter

I have definitely been asked that question on numerous occasions.  Obviously,
if it's someone I know, I will be honest with them.  If it's someone in a 
bike shop, I might tell them outright too.

If it's a total stranger on the street, however, what I normally say is that 
they can buy a folding bike for anything from $200 to $2000 or more, depending 
on what features they want, how comfortable, etc.  I then tell them I spent a 
little more on mine because I had it customized to match my specific 
measurements requirements.  Ultimately, however, I never actually say how much 
my specific Brompton cost.

My answer, I feel, tells them how much a generic folder could cost and
might even get them interested in getting an inexpensive folder whereas
the real cost of a Brompton could scare people away from the folding
experience.  By telling them that this bike is made to my specs, I'm hoping
to make it appear that its value is a lot lower to anyone else, because it
was really designed specifically for me.

I don't know if any of this works, but I haven't had my B ripped off
me yet! :)

Bike-jacking?  What a sad world.

here in my town we have massive bike theft -- and the police
just don't give a damn, as far as I can tell -- bikes are
"toys" and not real vehicles to them.  we have also petty
theft, like people stealing small parts off parked bikes --
I've actually had seat covers stolen, if you can believe
it --- people lose reflectors, even toe clips.

but we don't (yet) have criminals walking right up to us
and demanding our bikes at gunpoint, or knocking us down
and then stealing the bike.  sheesh.

I use this also ("$200 to thousands"), and indicate that my bike is 
high-quality mid-range.

Rarely have I given an exact amount -- less times than I've given Channell's 
number or website.

My personal (and actual) response -- "three months of extra overtime!"

The best is the expression on another Bromptoners face when he (never seen a
she on one) wonders why I don't have the front carrier fitting on my
machine. I mention that I bought mine in Hong Kong and that they don't (or
at least didn't have one). Then comes the million dollar question, how much
did it cost? I just say, "Less than half what you paid for yours mate!".
They usually ride away with a look of, "I've been done".

I am often asked that question, and will tell people if I know them. I
used to be more polite that I am now, and say "well, I can tell you
they don't give them away." Nowadays, though, unless the questioner
looks like someone who might tear me limb from limb, I just tell them
flat out that that is an impolite question and it is none of their
business. If I want to save my skin, I will say "a few hundred dollars"
and let it go at that.

I know the feeling - particularly if the people are "suspect". In such a
case, I usually say "more than you can afford" which may not be the best
answer, and not one I'd use in "heavy" circumstances.

I've had "How much for your bike ?" as well.

Has it actually got "nickable" properties ? For instance, do the hub gears
put theives off ?

While with the Brompton, I am frequently asked the question, "How much does
it cost?" It is by far the most common question asked.  At first it was a
bit humoring to see the incredulous expression on ones face when they find
out it costs more than  say a couple of hundred dollars (or any bicycle for
that).

Frequency aside, I do mind it a bit when asked such by a stranger on the
street.  "Bike jacking" is not such an uncommon thing here in NYC.  It's not
the only thought that pops into my head when asked.  Your opinion may
differ, but asking indiscriminately such a question to me is like asking
"How much money do you have in your wallet?" Yes, I am aware, for most it is
out of genuine curiosity, but it seems rather crude to ask.  When asked
sometimes I will tell the true cost other times I will give a low ball
figure.

I am sure other have been asked such question.  I am curious to learn how
other Brompton owners handle such situation.
Would anyone like to share their pithy or witty comments?  Thanks in
advance.  -Peter

Riding on my Brompton, I was in a particularly sour mood one day and thought about saying "Why should I tell you, you're not going to buy one anyway!"  Instead I said "More than you want to know".

We don't sell adult bikes at the Bikestation but do display a demonstrator L3 from Mr. Wasson on the platform along with a Neobike Traveler.  So far I've referred a couple of satisfied folks to Mr. Wasson.  The Neobike is part of our electric-assist bike fleet as the E.T.C. Traveller.  We also have Lafree from Giant.

We have a *HUGE* banner that says "*FREE* Electric Loaner Bikes" as they are no fees to use our fleet, only a $20 application fee.  The most common question asked is "How much do they cost" followed by "How fast do they go?"  People ask the first question even after we explain the free-use program.  When I'm in a particularly sour mood answering the second question I have told people "As fast as you can pedal" which is actually true for an electric-assist bike.

I'm usually extremely polite to patrons since it's my job and responsibility to promote bicycling and transit use.  Besides I love my job and love bicycling.

Isn't that "mid-quality" (more like sub-quality), "high-range"?

I'm very happy with the reduction gear.  I use it most every ride but maybe only
5% of the time.  That way I am avoiding the slight inefficiency of the extra
mechanism most of the time.  Of course your terrain is probably different.

I have often wanted higher (and lower) gears on my full size bike too, where I
also spin out at about 35 mph.  But that is a bit fast on the Brompton, I'm not
sure I'd be comfortable on such a short wheel base at that speed.  And I agree
with other postings that low gears are more important than high when you have to
choose.

I recall someone posting a year or so back that they had put two chainrings on a
mountain drive.  I have often fantasized about this.  Maybe we could get that 8
to 1 total span with Channell's front derailleur and the mountain drive?  I
could get up the hill without breaking a sweat and then break my neck on the
downhill.  But what a way to go.

Seriously, I'm ready to try this if someone has had success with it.

>Has it actually got "nickable" properties ? For instance, do the hub gears

I hope I have not caused alarm; "Bike jacking" is not rampant here, but I do
here stories from time to time.  For instance, it happened to one person in
the local bike club.  It occurred along a bridge entrance way that sees alot
of bicyclists pass through.  The man took the bike from her and ended up
selling it to a friend who a bit latter passed by and recognized the bike.
Meantime the other friends in the group flagged down the police.  It was an
expensive road bike and he sold it for $20.
In this case the lifted object could have been anything.

I think the real targets are double suspension mountain bikes. They have
great appeal to young men/teenagers and are quite a bit of $.  Yes, saddles,
reflectors, etc get stripped off of locked bikes on the street here, too.
As for the Brompton, I am not sure if it has a lot of nickable properties.
On the other hand, when I pass by teenagers, most think it's "cool".

Not to get into a long-winded argument here, but it would take my mother
(knowing only the basics of bicycles-they have two wheels, pedals, etc. ..)
to point out some of the Brompton's basic flaws.  I think some people on
this discussion list somehow merge design and manufacturing in one lump.
Truth is the "design" is quite sound.  There is not one folder out there
that I have seen that quite matches it.

But that said, it's the manufacturing-the attention to quality, design
improvement which severely lacks.  To get a feel for this one need only
listen to this discussion list for a few days and hear the talk of worn
rims, daily screw adjustments, handlebar flex . . . oh I could go on.
Where's the closure of this feedback loop from the customer?  The thing is
it could be so much better!

Thats true.  I could probably expand the list of components that might be 
classed "mid-range"  Perhaps I mis-spoke in calling it "high-grade"; though 
some elements are (frame, paint, hub-gear,...)

Actually it seems as though there are relatively few items mentioned as

And it gets better, as brakes, lights, tyres and handlebars prove. The
luggage system, the lights being safe inside the folded package, the
mudguards, the castors all tell there is attention for detail.

The Dutch got near it with drum brakes, enclosed chain, stainless steel
handlebars and Sturmey-Archer 3-speed.  The drum brakes were operated by
stainless steel rods to prevent breaking cables. They even managed to make a
reliable dynamo light.
It gets difficult to find this type of bike in our western neighbours'
shops.

"Better" is of course a relative thing and depends on what your vision for
what a "quality" bike is.  Sorry but my vision and expectation for quality
is high especially for that cost.  You're kidding yourself if you think the
two (low cost/high quality) are impossible to satisfy . . . it's done all
the time in my industry.  It's called improvement.  And sorry, but mudguards
just don't quite cut it.

In CA, next to impossible to find a bike in the shops with fenders.  And 
*none* have any lighting system.  Given it doesn't rain much here, but it 
does rain.  Personally, I think it ought to be City policy to at least 
require bikes be sold with bells.  My B had one thrown in by the dealer.

the answer obviously is "too much".  I thought so
when I bought mine, and I still think so :-)

on the other hand, it's a niche market and a very
special product.  no other bike can travel on a plane
with me as cheaply and easily as a B, and still be
a pleasant ride when I get where I'm going.

you can get a cheap tv for $100, and a dvd player for
about $250, but a tv/dvd player that fits in your pocket
is more like $1000.  why?  it folds :-)

before everyone jumps on that semi-weak analogy, my real
point was not that B technology can really be compared
to fast TFT screens and micro dvd packaging, but just
that when you have a really neat feature like Folding,
*and* you offer decent -- better than Dahon -- frame quality,
then you have a somewhat captive market and can charge
quite a bit.

also, I would bet the workers at the B plant are union,
well-paid, highly skilled etc, not some serfs in a 
sweatshop -- and this also affects product pricing.

fair market value is very hard to establish.  especially
with slave labour coming back into fashion and industrial
capital leaping with eagerness to exploit the new/old feudal
peasantry worldwide.  is something "too expensive" because
the people who made it were paid a living wage?  or should
we sometimes be looking askance at products and wondering
why they are so suspiciously cheap?

not saying that Dahon is necessarily a sweatshop operation,
since I have no idea one way or another -- just a general
observation on our perceptions of cost, value, and "fairness".

Does anyone know of a good quality frame pump to replace the Brompton
standard?  I would want it to go above 100 PSI and have pressure guage built
in.  I would also want it to fit where the Brompton standard fits now.  I
guess I would be open to a CO2 cartridge system as long as it fit.

I guess I would also consider one that didn't fit (for carrying in the
Brompton bag)...

What worn rims, what daily adjustments ? Is my bike about to fall to bits
because I've had these ?

Handlebar flex - yeah it does, so what ? It doesn't creak worryingly like
the alloy drops on my racer did.

I've not had a bike where I've had to replace a broken brake cable. In fact,
the cables on my 20 y/o racer have outlasted the frame - the frame didn't
bounce back into shape after impact !

And all cars should be sold with a folding bike !

It's been a talking point in the uk about bikes being sold with bells. I'd
rather not - have to buy something I don't need/want. I have an air horn on
mine.

Nice message.  I think in the case of Dahon, the price of their bicycles is
mainly attributable to economy of scale.  Either that or maybe I am a very
naive individual.  :-)   Such is true with mountain bikes and road bicycles
here.  An entry level price for a "quality" (as in non-department store)
road bike, like a Raleigh, costs roughly $700 versus $300 for a like kind
mountain bicycle.   As one would guess, mountain bicycles far outnumber road
bikes on the shop floor.

I see Dahons sold in bike shops here, but cannot say the same from the B.
With a greater volume of sales comes more distribution channels, or is that
the other way around?   Given current sales of Bs in the States, having more
dealers would be detrimental no doubt.  (I am quite pleased with Mr.
Wasson's service).  In general, margins for bicycles and bike parts are
quite slim.  - Peter

the answer obviously is "too much".  I thought so
when I bought mine, and I still think so :-)

on the other hand, it's a niche market and a very
special product.  no other bike can travel on a plane
with me as cheaply and easily as a B, and still be
a pleasant ride when I get where I'm going.

you can get a cheap tv for $100, and a dvd player for
about $250, but a tv/dvd player that fits in your pocket
is more like $1000.  why?  it folds :-)

before everyone jumps on that semi-weak analogy, my real
point was not that B technology can really be compared
to fast TFT screens and micro dvd packaging, but just
that when you have a really neat feature like Folding,
*and* you offer decent -- better than Dahon -- frame quality,
then you have a somewhat captive market and can charge
quite a bit.

also, I would bet the workers at the B plant are union,
well-paid, highly skilled etc, not some serfs in a
sweatshop -- and this also affects product pricing.

fair market value is very hard to establish.  especially
with slave labour coming back into fashion and industrial
capital leaping with eagerness to exploit the new/old feudal
peasantry worldwide.  is something "too expensive" because
the people who made it were paid a living wage?  or should
we sometimes be looking askance at products and wondering
why they are so suspiciously cheap?

not saying that Dahon is necessarily a sweatshop operation,
since I have no idea one way or another -- just a general
observation on our perceptions of cost, value, and "fairness".

Matt,

I bet you could mount one of the new Topeak Morph pumps (Road or Mountain 
model) in the same position as the stock pump using some velcro straps or 
something.  I have the predecessor to these pumps (the Combo Master 
Blaster) and it is far superior to any other frame type pump I have ever 
tried.  Here is the URL for the 
pumps:

I've been using the tiny Crank Brothers pump that fits into a seat bag,
and once you get the hang of it, it's surprisingly good.  It works for
both schrader and presta valves and has two settings--two cylinder pumping
for higher volume, lower pressure, and when that gets too hard single
cylinder for lower volume, higher pressure.  The key to getting it to work
properly, I've found, is to support the pump at the valve end and applying
slight pressure while pumping to be sure that it stays seated properly on
the valve.

It's quite rainy over here at the moment.  I'm not happy with that and
my Nordlicht dynamo is not happy with the new Schwalbe tyre.  I have to
force it with my heel for the first few minutes.  Then it obeys without
further hassle.  So it's better than with my last Primo that kept on
slipping, but worse than the first Primo that ran perfectly (until the
tyres thread succumbed to the dynamo wheel).

By coincidence I noticed the SpectroLux dynamo which attaches to geared
hubs, http://www.sram.com/spectro_lux.html.  After a wave of excitation,
I realised most likely it cannot be used on the Brompton with its narrow
hub - if it would fit Sturmey Archer hubs at all.

So what I really, really want, is a real front hub dynamo. Some German
individual (or was it just a face of the devil) here last year suggested
such a marvel was being developed.  I believed it and stopped whining
about dynamo's.  But what have we heard since?  Nada! I have just read
those mails again, and he was quite explicit in his crime.  There was a
prototype!  It was not just a hub dynamo, but ein Schmidt Original
Nabe!  

Not that I'm emotional over it.  But Roland, tell that Swiss guy to make
one for me or one day he might find a bar of Toblerone shoved up his
Presta valve.  Please.

Stein

Its named Son,  one online shop I know selling it (Son dynamo or built wheel)
is at http://www.pedalkraft.de/son.htm
I use one in my Kingcycle 20" front wheel, nice.

Hallo Stein,

The german devils face speaking again giving you some hope again (At least 
the one face, Thorsten with hair ;). As you can read on the SON web-page 
they are busy with developping the "BromSON".
There exists one version for 16"-20" wich will NOT work on the Brompton, 
cause of the smaller hub you need.
As we further inquired it seemed that they are very busy indeed with 
building their known hub dynamo not leaving any time to develop the 
"BromSON".

I think they will not forget about the "BromSON"
We'll keep you informed!

Thorsten (with hair)

Actually margins for bicycles are somewhat slim, especially the more expensive the bike but margins for parts and accessories are quite comfortable except for very high end material.  Although I must admit that I've never really worked in any other retail industry.

BTW, Dahon approached me to do a promotion through the Bikestation.  I asked Mr. Wasson, who displays a Brompton here, and he said "Fine, it'll help the Brompton".  We have a Neobike Traveller, used for our electric-assist program by ETC, on display too.  I've referred at least Brompton customers to Mr. Wasson but not a single person ever followed through with getting the Neobike.  Dahon wanted me to do the press release and make up flyers.  I'm much too busy to do that and I haven't heard from them.

Peter White, near Boston, has a page with many lighting items.
    http://www.peterwhitecycles.com/Schmidtbrochure.htm

This says Schmidt builds the SON for 26-27" and for 17-20" wheels.  You might 
inquire whether they would fit the 349 wheel (and also the hub width).  

I have it on a 26" wheel, and it works v well (the hub).  Would go for 
something other than the Lumotec standard front light. (the footprint is 
weird shape).  Perhaps the Lumotec Oval -- which has an LED that remains on 
at a stoplight.

PW also mentions a hub from Shimano...

I know, I see it spinning on my London every day (the only way to notice

I will keep faith and await the sign of The Maker.

Dear David,

    I too give a vote for the Crank Brothers Pump.  I agree that it is a bit
of a trick to learn how to use it properly, and is not effortless to inflate
to 100psi.  But I only use it for the occasional puncture, so the extra
effort is a rare event.  Mostly I like its astoundingly small size and
feather light weight.  I often don't even bother trying to get it up to full
inflation, but only hard enough to get to a gas station, etc.

        Bob

What about the old Sturmey Archer Dynohub (ie dyno + gears in one unit).
Would it be possible to lace one into a rim to fit a Brompton?

slipping due to the same problem. That was simply that the dynamo was at the
end of its sprung travel and therefore not being held against the tyre wall
properly.

I also feel it's worthwhile spending a little time ensuring correct
alignment of the dynamo's spindle. I have also encountered a dynamo which
has been excessively stiff to turn - sort of ok in the dry, but no chance in
the wet.

but worse than the first Primo that ran perfectly (until the
>tyres thread succumbed to the dynamo wheel).


Was the dynamo correctly aligned ?

>Not that I'm emotional over it.  But Roland, tell that Swiss guy to make
>one for me or one day he might find a bar of Toblerone shoved up his
>Presta valve.  Please.



Sensible thing to do with any Presta valve. I've never had one that's
provided a satisfactory seal when _trying_ to inflate a tyre. Everyone else
uses Schrader valves, so why shouldn't cyclists !

I'd like gears/brake rear, and dynamo/brake front !

Perhaps the same could be said of reflectors, which are by law here in CA.  
Sure, some folks are going to use nifty 
reflecto/candle-power/big_yellow_suits.  But the average jane/joe isn't going 
to bother; therefore they are left with nothing.  And that is dangerous -- 
for the rider, and for the conscientious driver trying to see in the dark 
(even with lights et al. it can really be difficult, eh?)

To many times have I been "surprised" by a cyclist whizzing by within inches. 
 Perhaps they could have called out.  Perhaps even with a bell they would not 
have used it.  But at 50p a pop, its not much of a cost; and it could be jsut 
the thing to prevent an accident. 

Better redundant equipment, than a redundant rider.  (Have I got my American 
and English sorted out right?)

At least you folks seem to be having the discussion.  Over here ...
P.

Ps: Air horn AND bell -- naughty AND nice.

I have a Nordlicht and it runs on the rim. In heavy rain it slips, but a 
gentle brake application cures this.

They're not here unless the bike's ridden on the road during the hours of
darkness. Some are supplied with and some are supplied without. Ditto
lights. Ditto mudguards. If I wasn't going to ride in the dark and wet, I
wouldn't really want to be spending money on those either.

I rarely use the horn while cycling among pedestrians, I also cycle at a
pedestian speed where I shouldn't be cycling. In shared use cases, I'll use
the horn only if there's that many predestrians going the same way as me
that totally block my way. I once used it on a particularly busy day - one
blast was enough, but the second wave ignored it, so I blasted again close
to them - it made them jump ! I got it to blast at the bus drivers though.

Vocals are as good as a bell - anyway, a light tap on the air horn is ok !

Stein,

before I take my last Toblerone to Belgium:

My Busch & Mller is no improvement. Wish I had bought the cheap AXA iQ. The Dutch seem to cycle in the rain.

I gather from this mail that you turned to violence lately

I actually held one in my hands last autumn. The other I saw on a Brompton recumbent. Last week I inquired at my LBS about Schmidt. I was told they were busy but the BromSon was not forgotten. But I believe the dynamo guy is german. I on the other hand have a Swiss mother and am particular about the misuse of their famous chocolate. 

Roland, the (not altogether) German individual:)

Really??  I thought the spring tension adjustment knob would eliminate
slippage.  I was disappointed about the noise it still makes, for such a
hefty price, so I didn't buy it.

Just intimidation.  I didn't do any Concordes (yet).

I even tried incorrect alignment for a change.  My recumbent also has a
Schwalbe tyre (albeit 26") and Nordlicht, but it never slips.  I mounted
it between plastic rings so I can align it while riding and it doesn't
seem to make any difference.

Road racers push up to 10 bar through their Prestas, I hear. Could it be
that your pump or - how to put this - aero-dynamic skills are to blaim?

Failing those, there's always temperature - the grease goes a bit stiff in
the cold ! With a little use, the dynamo warms up - problem solved.

I struggle to achieve a sound seal between valve body and air supply and due
to this large lump of nut attached directly to the valve seat, any slight
sideways pressure on that (which only just fits in the air supply tube)
stops it seating properly. That's something that can't happen with Schrader
valves.

I can see not supplying fenders.  Or lights even.  But reflectors -- they are 
a backup, for those times when one *meant* to be home 'for dark.

Still, by the necessity analogy: Americans have something like 100 Million 
bikes at home.  And probably 1% are ever used more than once.  'Suppose the 
rest could be sold from the shop w/o brakes/gears/... or -- as *some* 
American folder manufacturers do -- w/o seats and pedals!

The possibilities are indeed endless.

Stein,
You cursed my Brompton! Today the Busch&Mueller dynamo broke off and got into the rear wheel. It tore 2 nipples apart, wound the spokes round the hub and cut a deep scratch into the rim. 
This time the failure was not in the bracket on the carrier stay, but in the dynamo itself. This dynamo was considered to be a quality product, with all sort of signs and labels on it. B&M know how heavy their dynamo is. Is it so difficult to estimate the vibra	tions it has to withstand and to determine how strong the bracket should be?
At least I got rid of that wretched thing. Should I write to them before someone does the stunt on the front wheel?

While waiting for the BromSON I try the AXA Caluna.

twenty-six-spoke Roland from Germany

I tried for months to get a straight answer out of Freewheel.  Right before I sent money they finally admitted the hub they had would not fit a Brompton.

I just ordered a SON from Peter White for my big bike but still await word of the narrow version for the B.

The dyno part of the hub would not fit the left hand side of the rear triangle, same problem with 5 speed hub with internal brakes.

fascinating statistic, can you back it up?

sounds even worse than the use rate for small yachts in small
craft harbours :-)

>From an amusing conversation at the house of bike-oriented 
friends recently:

"I bike over to school with the kids in the morning.  The
 school is so close, you know, it's only about 3/4 of a mile
 from our house.  What's amazing is that other Moms from
 our same street DRIVE their kids over there.  There's this
 huge traffic jam at the school entrance with all these
 SUVs and wagons that just arrived from a few blocks away.
 People pay a fortune to live in this neighbourhood so they
 can be close to the school --" <general laughter>
 "And the other Moms are *so impressed* that I actually ride
 'all that way' from my house to the school.  All that way
 of less than a mile --" my hostess shakes her head sadly --
 "I mean what can you say, it's hopeless."

Sorry, I'm drifting off topic here, but it's fascinating to me 
that the automobile, which was supposed to shrink distances and 
make the world seem small and intimate, has produced a 
generation of people who think 3/4 of a mile is terribly far 
from their houses, a really impressive and taxing distance to 
walk or bike.  Now at last we understand why most of those 
bikes in the garages aren't used often -- gee, how much that's
interesting is there within one block of your house? <grin>

A month or so ago I remember stopping by the Freewheel with my Brompton.  They measured the front spacing realizing the hub would not work.  I know they wanted to put one on my Brompton but I'm happy with my rechargeable lighting system although I dream of getting a Cateye Stadium!

Sorry!  I'll offer you all the Toblerone you can have when you come by.
Come on, you can do it! A German friend did it in one stretch - 270km on
a three speed...

They are worse on the stiff little wheels - remember Brompton's stock

Surely B&M will replace it without charge - if not refund?  Even the
Nordlicht at a quarter of the price has three years of warranty.

I don't know how big US garages are, but what I often hear from
friends in the UK and here in the Netherlands is the classic
excuse: "the bikes are at the back of the garage and we have to
move the car to get at them, so it's not worth getting them out
for short distances". Presumably the SUV (is this American for
"Einkaufspanzer"?) just makes this worse.

I sometimes use my Brompton for trips where folding is not
really required, because it lives upstairs and I don't feel up
to coping with the 3-D jigsaw puzzle of six bikes in a small
basement, so I can see their point...

De,  
Most of the information quoted came from my August 00  Journal  
Of Kinetic Energy book.  Despite what you might think, the submissions are 
all pretty short; most being one-liners.

As to their veracity, I have my own doubts, statistically speaking.  But as a 
ball-park "analysis", I think it hits the nail on the head.  Actually, I 
think the numbers in garages and basements probably figures to be 2x or 3x 
that.  Of course many are used more than once.  But they do seem to reside 
more in a potential, than kinetic,  state, eh?

Probably the biggest criticism or them -- is that they do not fold away
.
P.     :-)

Before I got the Brompton, the bike was at the front of the narrow garage so
it had to come out first to get the car out !

AXA IQ 1 failed in 1 month - felt like the bits that shouldn't go round,
did. I suspect something came loose during a fold/unfold operation.

No.2 was a bike shop temporary replacement while No.3 was supposed to
arrive. No.2 was too stiff to work reliably in the wet.

No.3 is still going strong after a year. I got it from Brompton direct as
the bike shop are pathetic.

The punchline was that I was told that the dynamo was only for light use.
Err, I only use it for the lights ?! :)

BTW, after detecting stiffness in the operation of the on/off action, it got
oiled. It has now bounced OFF once and ON 3 times. I think 100 psi in the
tyres has something to do with that :)

They measured the front spacing realizing the hub would not work.  I know
they wanted to put one on my Brompton but I'm happy with my rechargeable
lighting system although I dream of getting a Cateye Stadium!


And I'm quite happy with this bottle dynamo - just the back light I'm not
happy with.

A very fine kit.  Clearly not mass produced (yet?) but a very solid piece of
work.  Quick to install and can be easily removed but I doubt anyone would want
to.  You do lose the front bag but the back of the seat will take most
panniers.  I needed to add a strap for the lower hook of my pannier though.

It's not cold outside though, so in the winter it would be hopeless? 
Would a drop of oil in the Nordlicht help?

Anyone else had breaks at nipple I've had two in 500 miles riding !!!
75 Kg on road, no rough stuff silliness ;-) 4 punctures/ one tyre (schwalbe)
failure - bad fortune??

And another thing....Brompton told me that the waterproof cover goes over
the tourig bag too. That may be true if you dont actually put anything in
the bag? The rear pockets seem to be waterproof but the main compartment
certainly isn't.

Perhaps either it's stiff than it should be or the spring is too weak
holding the dynamo against the tyre - or that pivot is too stiff ?

Please say more about the tyre failure - what happened ?

I've had 16 stone on mine - I suspect my 1 spoke break was due to vehicular
side impact, but not sure.

Does anyone know of a source for spokes for the Brompton
in the USA?

Also, can you confirm spoke lengths for the front and back?
I am measuring 6 inches for the back and 5 7/8 inches for
the front.

I have an L3, but I'm guessing that spoke-sizes don't vary
between the models.

Thanks in advance for any help.

Farrell Ostler

P.S. I have been off the list for some time, but just in case there
is still room for tales of foolishness and deering do, I'd like to =
mention
my new traveling solution.

A large Samsonite suitcase, marked down by 60% to $75, recently
caught me eye at Dillards Department store. I checked the dimensions and =
found that,
if I remove the seat posts, either my L3 or my Birdy fit
inside. (BTW: The suitcase is not hard shell but rather
fabric over a frame. The Birdy seatpost removes without complication =
"out the top"
but the Brompton requires removal of the seat and goes out the bottom.)

I was on my 26-inch mountain bike that day, so I extended the suitcase =
towing handle,
tied it to the bike and towed it eight miles home on its =
rollerblade-sized wheels.

In mid July I was in the New York City area on pleasure followed by =
business.
I took it as a chance to try out the new travel solution. The transition =
from pleasure
to business required me to transport myself from Jersey City, NJ to =
Elmsford, NY (near
Tarrytown). I spent a pleasant afternoon riding the L3 --suitcase =
trailing behind--up
the NJ side of the Hudson, across the Washington Bridge, through Yonkers =
and
on to Elmsford. (More pleasant, and less fatiguing, in my estimation, at =
least,
than standing in tourist lines and walking around Manhattan.)

I expect I'll get many more trips out of the suitcase if, after a few =
more
trips, I am able to change the wheels, which--surprise--are already =
showing
some wear.

They do require two different spoke wrenches.

I have happily lurked on this list for a couple of years. Great fun.
Actually bought a second Brompton, the Companion, for seaside riding not
alone. No regrets. In the space of one hour in Delaware, met four folders
and an A to B subscriber.  All drooled over the Brompton. After wiping up,
continued on my vacation.

I recall a brief thread here about shaft-driven bicycles. I had never
heard of one and then in this morning's mail there arrived a catalogue
that featured one. I have attached a scan of the page with picture. Hope
it is viewable. At 38lbs. and three minutes to unfold it does not appear
to be much competition for other folders.  But it is an interesting
machine.

I think Wheelsmith is considered the premier source for spokes in the USA.  Spokes generally have metric measurements.  Some bicycle shops have expensive spoke cutting machines which roll a new set of threads.  You might also consider whether you want double butted spokes.

Does anyone know of a source for spokes for the Brompton
in the USA?

Also, can you confirm spoke lengths for the front and back?
I am measuring 6 inches for the back and 5 7/8 inches for
the front.

I have an L3, but I'm guessing that spoke-sizes don't vary
between the models.

Thanks in advance for any help.

UK Brompers within reach of Peterborough may like to know that it is =
receiving its final launch on 3rd September 2000. Info is on the =
www.peterborough.gov.uk website. What I've seen of surfaces suggests =
that it may be more Brompable than some cycle paths I've attempted =
recently. It would be nice to get as many of us participating as =
possible, Peterborough being very much a railway centre and therefore of =
great concenience for us. Only wish I lived there rather than 40 miles =
further north.

Hi Nico,

I had this on my T5 for a while. Everytime I hit a bump
there was an almighty 'clang' sound. I originally thought that
it was the rear jockey wheels...however, I found out that the
back wheel was very slighly loose. i.e. the compression nut
on the rear bearings was not done up enough. I found this
out by turning the bike upside down and gripping the wheel,
and being able to rock it side to side very slightly. I
took the wheel off and did up the compression nut just
enough to stop the play - but no more than that as the
bearings will wear out prematurely if too tight.

Maybe this is it? I hope this helps.

Stuart

I now follow for some time the most interesting discussions on, for =
instance, a drop of specific oil in freezing dynamo's and lenght of =
spokes. Brompton lives!
I bought, some one and a half year ago a T3. Great fun. Everybody wanted =
folding demo's.
However, after some time a vague clanking started in the neighbourhood =
of the back-wheel.
Couldn't find exactly where. I performed greasing and tightening of =
screws and nuts. Didn't solve the problem.
So: back to the dealer, who checked the bike.=20
"Did you solve my problem"? No, that appeared to be not really possible. =
Had to do with something within the nave of the back-wheel. A common =
Brompton problem. Dismantling the nave would not give any solution.
Not very satisfactory! The rattling became worse (and in Holland we do =
not have tarmac everywhere as in California).
So I wrote to the factory. Answer came from the main distributor in =
Holland by telephone. A nice chat about grease, oil, tirepressure etc. =
However it may be: a well known problem! Had to do with the general =
construction: only one hinge between back and front parts and therefor =
no possibility to spread the rumour over the total frame.
Again, not satisfactory. I'm now in the stage to advise others not to =
buy Brompton, unless they can cope with a lot of, now very noisy =
rattling. I took the nave completely apart, greased, oiled, well did =
everything, but the problem still exists.
Question: is this Brompton nave really a weak spot? What can, for =
heavens sake, be done? The bike of my youngest son rides more quite(!) =
than my expensive B.
Regards

    I bought, some one and a half year ago a T3. Great fun. Everybody =
wanted folding demo's.
    However, after some time a vague clanking started in the =
neighbourhood of the back-wheel.
    I'm now in the stage to advise others not to buy Brompton, unless =
they can cope with a lot of, now very noisy rattling. I took the nave =
completely apart, greased, oiled, well did everything, but the problem =
still exists.
    Question: is this Brompton nave really a weak spot? What can, for =
heavens sake, be done? The bike of my youngest son rides more quite(!) =
than my expensive B.
    Regards
No pun intended ? but this is the first I have heard of this. My 1=B75 =
year old T5 does not make any strange noises. Perhaps you have something =
odd about yours ?

Is that why I didn't get an attachment ? God has spoke ?

It seems that rules are being applied in the wrong places. 

Bill Gates, it's all your fault.

Just been and greased the wheels...they are swines to undo as Brompton =
have used loctite on them....needed a foot long flat screwdriver with =
self grip wrench clamped to the shaft of the screwdriver, before they =
were beaten!Need to rest the bike on a solid surface and really lean on =
the screwdriver handle to stop it slipping.On a quick roadtest, bike is =
much quieter(you don't realise how noisy it is until the rattle has =
gone.....)
The little wheel on the back of the mudguard is riveted together, may be =
worth drilling out so it can be greased,but I sprayed some gooey =
motorcycle chain lube on it ...seems to have done the trick.See if =
that's the problem on your bike.....
ps don't forget to reloctite the screws
happy folding.
Jonathan

        I bought, some one and a half year ago a T3. Great fun. =
Everybody wanted folding demo's.
            However, after some time a vague clanking started in the =
neighbourhood of the back-wheel.
            I'm now in the stage to advise others not to buy Brompton, =
unless they can cope with a lot of, now very noisy rattling. I took the =
nave completely apart, greased, oiled, well did everything, but the =
problem still exists.
            Question: is this Brompton nave really a weak spot? What =
can, for heavens sake, be done? The bike of my youngest son rides more =
quite(!) than my expensive B.
            Regards
            No pun intended ? but this is the first I have heard of =
this. My 1=B75 year old T5 does not make any strange noises. Perhaps you =
have something odd about yours ?

Sorry, but it wasn't the fault of God, or even the higher power of Bill
Gates, it was me, the List Server Admin.

The reason attachments are not allowed is that not everybody wants to
download files or view pictures via email. It's also very inefficient to
send everyone on the list (about 280 people from all over the world) the
same file. It's much more efficient to allow those interested in seeing the
image to access it with their web browser.

I apologize for the delay, I was out riding my bike and not tending the web
server.

some weeks ago I took my Sprinter 5 apart. I found that a tiny spring from a
paw had come loose. After reassembly the hub was much quieter, but has
started to rattle again. I don't know if the rattle is the same in all gears
or if it depends on the gear I drive. I confess I forget to sort that out
every time I enjoy a ride.
On my Gazelle with SA 3-speed a noise appeared at 10000 km. In an
advertisement by Sachs I found a sentence like: "some hubs are reported to
have lasted for 10000 km". Surely 10000 km is nothing Sturmey-Archer would
advertise about. The Gazelle is now well above 30000 with the hub still
going. It even gets quieter, or perhaps my ears worse :)

Yes, the noise is a problem on my bike as well. About a year ago there
was a thread in this list about it. I went as far as removing everything
on the rear triangle and came to conclude that it originates at the hub.
I promised myself to take the hub apart but haven't come round to it
yet. One of the list members described how he had ruled out the coasters
by riding with his feet on the rear carrier touching the coasters. Don't
try this at home was his sound advice.

I compared the noise to empty cans on a string being pulled behing the
bike. Very entertaining on cobblestones. I wouldn`t go as far as
advising people against buying a Brompton, but it is definately much
less enjoiable on poor surfaces. Now that the brake issue is solved we
might get to the bottom of this. Has anybody experiene with other hubs
on the Brompton? I know the rear triangle is too narrow to take other
hubs unmodifieed, but have heard of several attempts to use the Sachs 3
and 5 Speed and even the Rohloff. Do they clank as well? And what makes
that clanking noise in the Sturmey-Archer? Any ideas?

I now follow for some time the most interesting discussions on, for
instance, a drop of specific oil in freezing dynamo's and lenght of
spokes. Brompton lives!
I bought, some one and a half year ago a T3. Great fun. Everybody wanted
folding demo's.
However, after some time a vague clanking started in the neighbourhood
of the back-wheel.
Couldn't find exactly where. I performed greasing and tightening of
screws and nuts. Didn't solve the problem.
So: back to the dealer, who checked the bike. 
Did you solve my problem? No, that appeared to be not really possible.
Had to do with something within the nave of the back-wheel. A common
Brompton problem. Dismantling the nave would not give any solution.
Not very satisfactory! The rattling became worse (and in Holland we do
not have tarmac everywhere as in California).
So I wrote to the factory. Answer came from the main distributor in
Holland by telephone. A nice chat about grease, oil, tirepressure etc.
However it may be: a well known problem! Had to do with the general
construction: only one hinge between back and front parts and therefor
no possibility to spread the rumour over the total frame.
Again, not satisfactory. I'm now in the stage to advise others not to
buy Brompton, unless they can cope with a lot of, now very noisy
rattling. I took the nave completely apart, greased, oiled, well did
everything, but the problem still exists.
Question: is this Brompton nave really a weak spot? What can, for
heavens sake, be done? The bike of my youngest sonrides more quite(!)
than my expensive B.
Regards

Boy, I'm happy my T5's are quiet.  I'm very sensitive to noise,
sometimes even the ticking in higher gears gets on my nerves.
The Sachs 7 speed on my recumbent however rattles annoyingly, although I
wouldn't compare it to pulling empty cans.  It also has some gear
changing problems.  The Sachs 5 on my cumbersome are quiet until they
implode (which took four months for the first two).

I read on the Utopia Forum that the Rohloff 14 speed makes a distinct
grinding noise in the lowest gears.  The Shimano hubs are reported to
exhibit not even ticking, but I know someone who complained that the
roller brake rattled like hell.  I rode one recently and it was very
quiet and braking power smoothly controllable. Alas, maximum braking
power couldn't match an original Saccon brake on a Brompton in the rain.

Once a cumbersome made a clanking noise.  It turned out that the outer
cylinder of the Sturmey Archer drum brake, on which the left spokes are
attached, was moving with respect to the rest of the hub.  That was a
few years after the axle broke (solid - no gears). In Sturmey Archers
defense, I rescued the bike from the scrap container ten years earlier.

The loudest rattle on my Brompton comes from something I fitted 
myself, a Swiss made Nordlicht dynamo. It's a rattle from the 
mechanism to keep it away from the wheel when not in use.

Hmmm, is there something in the air this morning?  
My Nordlicht is spring loaded whether engaged or not - how can it
vibrate?

I've never used any but heard there are types of Loctite.  The website
http://www.loctite.co.nz/threadlocker.htm featurs 5 strengths in
permanent and 2 strengths in removable threadlockers.  And I suppose
there are other brands.

They claim it protects against rust too, so removable threadlocker may
actually allow *help* unscrewing...

        I bought, some one and a half year ago a T3. Great fun. =
Everybody wanted folding demo's.
        However, after some time a vague clanking started in the =
neighbourhood of the back-wheel.
        I'm now in the stage to advise others not to buy Brompton, =
unless they can cope with a lot of, now very noisy rattling. I took the =
nave completely apart, greased, oiled, well did everything, but the =
problem still exists.
        Question: is this Brompton nave really a weak spot? What can, =
for heavens sake, be done? The bike of my youngest son rides more =
quite(!) than my expensive B.
        Regards
      No pun intended ? but this is the first I have heard of this. My =
1=B75 year old T5 does not make any strange noises. Perhaps you have =
something odd about yours ?

It doesn't. However, the bit of metal that one presses to engage the 
dynamo does rattle on mine when the dynamo is not engaged.

Following my message about noise I saw a truck-load of reactions. All had to
do with rattling and other noisy sounds in a number of parts.
Still happy with the Bromptons? We are all, of course, very impressed by the
clever folding-solution and other fine qualities but, however it may be,
this kind of bike, apart from the fact that it is relatively heavy, has at
least one essential bad quality and that's the noise it produces.
Structural! I never owned a (normal) bike with this kind of shortcoming.
I cannot image that there's no appropriate solution for this structural
weakness.

loctite is good stuff,and cures those bolts/nuts that always work loose...
but only use the blue kind that can be dismantled with normal tools.A
hairdryer to heat things up can loosen previously loctited fastenings.I
think the green version is the permanent?,,,,if you use that, drilling out
is required, so be careful....Jonathan

I didn't like the hub ratchet noise as I like silence, but I have accepted
it. My Dad said his went quiet after years of use - which worried him, so he
renewed the pawl springs to get the noise back again ! I'll be glad if mine
disappears and as long as it works fine (as dad's did although silent) I
won't be doing anything about it !

The Mk 1 Mk 2 (as opposed to the original Mk 1) with 1" headset, and 20 spoke

laced (2x rear) there is always a propensity to break spokes.

For waterproof luggage that takes A4/foolscap sheets flat you can't go far 
wrong with a UKP 2.99 Sainsbury box, with UKP0.99 lid, on our large carrier 
frame - or for watertight luggage get the frame with a top box (waterproof at 
70+mph on a motorbike).

I can't say that I experienced ANY noise during 1500 miles on my T5, except 
normal tracktion sound, due to the chain running.
Might it be a result of the fact that I did not change anything to my B, 
and that no other grease, oil has been put on or in antyhing of my B? ;-)

Likewise, we haven't experienced any significant noise on either of our two
Bromptons in more than ten years (no idea of mileage), certainly no worse
than with our various conventional bikes.

Don't want to spoil this fascinating string, but surely a product which is
at least in part hand built will vary; the type of use it's put to will
affect likelihood of rattles, squeaks etc developing; and - this is
something which has been alluded to before, I think - what about the weight
of the rider and possible load? As someone who has experienced none of the
problems previously referred to concerning the brakes, gears etc, I wonder
whether this has something to do with my being relatively(?) light - about
150lb - compared with those whose Bromptons appear more troublesome.

Well I'm 13 and a half stone and I've had an additional 3 stone of shopping
on it and no odd rattles.

What is all this stuff about noise from the hub gears? Perhaps I 
never cycle anywhere quiet enough to hear my bike or my tinnitus 
drowns it! The roads I cycle on are so rough & the traffic so 
noisey the only thing I ever hear is the stand wheels rattling a bit 
& the general sound generated by the whole bike being pounded & 
vibrated. There is one road I use in the New Forest which has worn to 
a wonderful polished smooth finish where I only hear the sound of the 
tyres. 

Try cycling in the centre of Taunton, Somerset which has certainly 
improved its appearance. The interesting experience is produced by 
the large jointed pavoir blocks on the cycle lanes. It's the place 
for vibro-massage en route!

I remember my old Sachs 3 speed with back-pedaling brake: no ratchet

I've managed it with a derailleur by filling the freewheel with grease -
rather nice !

Greetings all

I have added the Carradice Rackbox to my line of Carradice products. 
This bag was designed specifically for small wheeled bikes. Only 
problem is; my wife's Brompton doesn't have a rack so I can't take 
pictures of it on a bike for my web catalog.

For the first person who promises one or two publishable pictures 
(and perhaps some feedback) in a timely manner I will knock $20 off 
the $75 cost of the bag. E-mail for more description and details.

Best regards

A question about a the front brake.

Why is the cable routed so as to pull in a downwards direction/recently my
cable broke and the emergency replacement was a shorter cable that could not
be routed in the same way. Therefore after a few bits of un-screwing and
swping bits about, the brake no pulls upwards. The improvement os amazing!
So amazine i wonder if I should do it on the back too.

As everyone knows, Brompton brakes leave a little to be desired. yet on the
similar old Moulton, it was not an issue. Is it due to this routing of the
brake cables that efficency is lost?

Is there a fellow Brompton user in London who could lend me a 
Brompton to use for 5 days .. 22nd August to 27th August ?

I am going on a short break by car to France taking my Brompton 
(T3 with 10% reduction gearing) with me for local sight-seeing at 
our destination.   My wife has said she would like to try cycling as 
well and this seems a great chance to try and convert her !

Can you help by lending me a Brompton .

If no-one has a bike to lend, I believe one of the cycle shops which
advertises in A2B magazine offers hire of Bromptons, the cost of which is
deducted from the price of the cycle if subsequently purchased.

A bit behind but I have the same loud noise mostly when I freewheel. Not
little wheels. My new mk III is fine after approx 1000k

Phoenix Cycles Battersea (Mike Hullis)
and 
Cyclecare Olympia (Tim Whitty) both have demonstration/hire bikes.

IIRC Tim is more likely to hire out for longer periods

That's quite interesting. Is it still the same Saccon caliper ? I get an
impression that the caliper bends too much !

BTW, any suicidal maniacs out there near Birmingham UK ? I'll give this
Brompton tyre to the first person that collects it. It nearly had me on the
road again today :((((((
Scwalbe now fitted.

The Light speed comments were an interesting take.  I was thinking more or
less in terms of the sound of tires humming, the chain engaging in the
rings, more wind blowing past your ears, etc.  and the psychological angle
of such noises seeming trivial when you are working up a good sweat.

Greetings,

I have one of Ben Cooper's Zap Bromptons.  As I have the motor I don't 
need lower gearing, but I do often with I had something a bit higher.  
With only the 3-speed hub I find pedalling at >20mph tiring and above 
25mph I might as well not bother.

Has anyone tried Ben's front chain rings? I figure if I keep one the 
same as my current one, but also fit one that's smaller by maybe 30% 
I'll get my top gear sorted and might also get a couple of useful 
settings with my 1st and 2nd gears.

Thoughts?

Ian Oliver

Confusion, mostly.  Higher gearing through a smaller front chain ring?
If you meant 30% bigger, you won't easily find a 65 tooth to complement
your standard 50 tooth, that is if you don't have reduced gearing. 
Channell has 53 & 39 teeth, that's over 30%, but mainly lower.

Ur, yes, sorry quite right.  I'm not a cyclist, I'm just someone who goes 
to work on a bike. I have to think about this stuff and I kind of missed 
out that stage. [blush]

I guess I don't need 30% bigger, but I'd like to be able to cycle at 
25mph+ whereas at the moment my legs are a blur! What do most people do? 
Use a 5-speed hub at the back? Swap to a derailleur?

This might be an option http://www.schlumpf.ch/en_Inhalt.html  but at 
$300 before the bits to fit to a Brompton (but info. on doing it is on 
the site) it's a bit expensive!

Ian

    I vote for calling "someone who goes to work on a bike" a cyclist, Ian!
Paying attention to the bits and pieces is not a prerequisite.

    The schlumpf gear is not so expensive when you consider that a new
internally hubbed rear wheel might cost $150-$200 for parts and labour, and
the range of gearing produced would not even approach what you would have
with the Schlumpf Mountain Gear.

        Bob

Are the Primos slippery in the wet ? My slick Record wasn't - well worn
smooth, but still stuck to the road. It's more the material than the tread
pattern that matters.

HEY ! it's just thrown a shower - I'll go try the Schwalbe now !

...but still rather a lot more expensive than a larger chain ring...

Dear Richard,

    Beats me.  I thought "$" meant dollars and the "L" thing with the lines
thu it was pounds (I know that symbol is hidden on my keyboard
somewheres...).  Truly, here in the US, a new rear wheel with internal hub
would be $150 minimum to buy, including parts and labour.  Schlumpf had his
gear on sale for around $300 (US) at one time.

        Bob

Hi all

I removed my name from list about 3 weeks ago as was off on holiday. I have
signed in again. Have I missed any updates on Len's Ultimate folding
Brompton bike. I would be grateful if you could up date me.

Many thanks Gavin from Aberdeen.

Len wrote to me a few weeks ago and told me that I could expect my two bikes
at the end of this month.  That's the last I heard.

Did someone mention my name?

As many of you know I have spent every spare moment and dollar over the last
four years or so developing prototypes of some diabolical ultralight,
professionally equipped human-powered urban stealth vehicle inspired by the
Brompton. A few of you have even purchased and are currently commuting on
some of these prototypes. many more of you have curiously and patiently
followed the rumors and sightings.

Having created a busy network computer consulting company to fund the
endlessly expensive research and development of this elusive fantasy, I have
found myself increasingly unable to personally participate in most of the
fabrication or even ride much anymore these days! I am reduced to
manufacturing money, and managing the several brilliant designers and
fabricators who know toil away at my dream for me.

Last week I received the long-awaited and much-anticipated last prototype
iteration/first "production" test sample (what in the computer world would
be called the "Golden Master") of the heart of the UFB (Ultimate Folding
Bicycle, formerly known as the "SuperBrompton" project) -- the rear
triangle. 

The last several days have been particularly busy for me. Each day after
working a grueling 16-18 hours doggedly transforming computer problems into
solutions, grafting order onto chaos and often driving hundreds of miles up
and down the clogged arteries of the San Francisco Bay Area (sadly ironic
for the technological heart of the world), I would wearily glance at the
triangle sitting in my shop downstairs, and then climb up into bed, unable
to even think of picking up a tool.

Last night I finally said, "Tonight is the night!", and at 1:00 A.M. I
completed the assembly of the bike!

I then test rode it up and down a couple of the more imposing hills of San
Bruno -- and I was re-animated! The new rear triangle is amazingly light and
simultaneously surmounts several formidable design challenges that have been
vexing me all along.

I am finally pretty satisfied with the latest geometry and engineering (and
I am not easily satisfied, as my now extensive consortium of bicycle and
aerospace fabricators will all tell you!)

Last night's build, with 27 gears, a stock unmodified Brompton main frame,
the Brompton folding pedal (heavy enough to satisfy the Russian military)
and our patented on-the-fly adjustable stem -- which fairly matches that
pedal in over-engineered mass -- weighed in at 21.4 lbs. (that's with a
STEEL rear triangle, folks!!!). I am now satisfied that we will deliver our
promised curb weight of 20.5 lbs. for the complete steel UFB and, at most,
17.5 lbs. for the Titanium one.

Our first production run of rear triangles is in steel, and then we shift
production to Titanium. a few of these will be loaned to customers who have
orders in for Titanium, but are anxious to ride their new bikes while they
wait for the Ti production. When I get these back, they will represent some
additional steel ones available for sale (the first run of steel triangles
is otherwise sold out.)

I am taking orders/deposits on the next run. As I indicated previously, I am
also considering producing a version with an internally-geared hub for the
UK/European market.

We also have a new goodie: a re-designed Titanium replacement frame for the
front cargo bag. As soon as I get some sleep, I will try to post some new
pictures on the site!

If you are interested in any of these items, please don't respond here --
contact me privately at: info@ultimatefoldingbike.com

Thanks again to all who have sustained interest over these past few years
and supported this unusual project,

-Len "Mr. Folding Bike" Rubin

On tarmac they were fine, but on cobbles and raised manholes they were 
lethal. We have loads of both in Leeds.

They also suffered with all the broken glass I have to ride over - bits were 
getting pulled off and then glass was causing many punctures.

Good tyres, but perhaps not great for inner-city Leeds in the wet.

Ian

> Are you getting currencies mixed here isn't Ian talking GBP and Bob USD?

I was talking dollars as the Schlumpf web site only has pricing in EUR 
(300), USD (300) and CHF (300 swiss franks).  As it happens it's cheaper 
for my to buy in Euros and works out to about GBP 185.

I'm tempted as as someone said, a larger chain ring will be VERY large.

Regards

Ian

Is this list archived anywhere? Or would some kind soul bombard me with 
copies of relevant emails? 

Asking stupid questions is one thing, but asking the same stupid 
question someone asked a few weeks back is another.

Oh, and does anyone in the UK have a spare nut for the Brompton 
Sturmey-Archer? The one the chain goes through?  Like a gorilla I 
over-torqued mine (AKA broke) and can't get another for a few days. 
It's currently bodged, but second is a bit suspect.

Regards

Ian Oliver

The casing failed causing a huge bulge which would eventually have burst
completely perhaps 40  miles after discovery. It was replaced by dealer

Sorry my mistake the last time I looked at the Schlumpf site it only gave
prices in Swiss Francs 478.
At the time the pound wasn't so strong neater 2.3 than the 2.56 it is now
which is gbp200+ plus VAT @ 17.5% which seemed excessive, 1/2 the cost of the
bike

I found a Primo on the back gripped noticeably worse in the wet than a
Record, to the point where I didn't feel safe.

I now have Schwalbes front and back.  Good roadholding, excellent
puncture resistance (until they wear through), but VERY SHORT TREAD LIFE
- and I see someone has reported the same experience in the latest A to

To be fair I've only gone through 1 Schwalbe so far, and I didn't
measure its life accurately, but subjectively I reckon it must be well
under half the life of a Record.  Still, they're not that expensive and
for me the absence of punctures compared to Records or Primos outweighs
reduced lifespan.

That rattling around the rear wheel has now struck my new Mark 3 whilst
freewheeling and its starting to rattle after around 6-700 miles. It is
irritating on a less than smooth surface, my older bike is very noisy and
rattles a little even when pedalling. Something must be loose as my front
cones need substantial tightening too.

Why should some rattle and others not? Haven't tried to tighten anything
yet, keep you posted

Mark

> 5 speed 10/96

So clearly both 3 and 5 speeds can rattle.  How about Stuart's tip?  On
my silent 5 speed (4/96), wheel play is barely feelable. Mark and Nico,
how is yours?

Channell spoke of "thread separation" in an early batch of Schwalbes; my
bike shop warned about the (same?) problem when I bought my pair.  One
would be forewarned by a bulge developing tens of miles before things
get dangerous.  You can exchange them without charge, but obviously it's
quite inconvenient to have to do so.  It didn't happen to me; it sure
happened to someone who's letter is printed in the latest A to B. But
I'm puzzled about Chris's story and the remark in the "Map of London"
item in A to B.  Are they thread separation victims or does the Schwalbe
really wear quickly?

One tyre brand I will not defend is Vredestein.  I've had three out of
four fail before they were worn and hear the same from many people. 
Albeit their Puncture Resistance System never let me down, and the tyres
did warn up front so they're not dangerous.

Not knobbly, so the motor gripped well, and could handle 85psi so very 
low rolling resistance.

It already seems pretty small. I'll chat the Ben and see what he says. 
He does rear derailleurs so I could go the whole hog!

Exactly the same with me but I'd gone to a Brompton tyre from a Record.

It's the standard tyre trade-off, lots of grip and wear OR little wear and
little grip.

Perhaps the answer is to keep a minimum of 100psi in the tyre.

Roughly, a Record did me for a year (rear). The reason it had to go was a
cut was growing and the inner tube was clearly visible.

 Still, they're not that expensive and

I think I'll agree with you on that although the interesting thing is that
the new Record I had last December hasn't had a puncture yet, but it is on
the front. Are punctures a rear wheel phenomenon in general ? Could it be
that the tyres are overloaded hence causing the problems ?

Is "rattle" additional to pawl noise ? If so, mine's silent, just pawl
noise. It's a 5 speed (Sprinter).

That's nicely led onto a related point. How many of you select 2nd gear for
freewheeling down hills with 5 speeds. 2nd seems to have the least number of
clicks when freewheeling, is therefore quieter and I presume there are less
parts being worn. With long descents, I do it as standard now.

I was about to check my manual for cone tightening check intervals, can't

Further to my chance emergency fixing of the front brake so that it no
longer pulls downwards, I found that braking efficiency was vastly improved.
I've not made it permanent. And for the bake too. I have re-routed the cable
and change the fitting around so that it too pulls in the opposite
direction. Wow! Fantastic improvement in braking.

So I ask the question I asked earlier - but which only got replies about
tires. Does anyone know why Bromptons brakes are cabled the way they are?
Have I discovered something special, or am I going to have massive brake
failure going down the steepest of hills one day soon?

There are suddenly lots of what seem to be UK built Bromptons for sale in
Hong Kong at VERY low prices. Even lower than the Neobike licensed version.
Anyone know why? They are all pre-latest-improvement models, prices are
about US70 below the Neobike Bromptons. And incase you are wondering, yes I
can spot the differences. I have both models. Did Brompton UK send them to
Asia, or just maybe, are the Neobike versions now EXACTLY as the UK
Bromptons were prior to the changes?

Makes you wonder. And I'm wondering!

Pete,

Does the new cable routing compromise folding?  If not, why don't people 
just get some nice Shimano dual pivots to improve the braking?  I have 
always assumed that the bottom entry cable routing was necessary for folding...

Thanks, Doug

I guess the routing is designed assist folding, yes. But I have found very
little difference. I can think that it does put a bit more wear on the back,
at the front the cables tend away from the from a bt when folded. But it's
no problem.

Pete,

Does the new cable routing compromise folding?  If not, why don't people
just get some nice Shimano dual pivots to improve the braking?  I have
always assumed that the bottom entry cable routing was necessary for
folding...

Thanks, Doug

Ian,

I've read the review of the ZAP Brompton in A to B magazine but I'd be
very interested to hear your longer-term experiences of it.  I'm
guessing that this would also be of interest to others on this list.

HK$3,250 for the three-speed
HK$4,500 for the five-speed
But you can bargain! Freigh charges would be your problem. Around HK$1,000
by air, half that by sea (but long time).

Hmmm, not massively cheap, but still a worth while saving.  Bargaining 
seems to be part of the system in HK.  I can live with that!

I can use some airmiles and pop over for a short holiday some time. The 
Brompton will easily go in luggage (buy that there too!) for the return 
trip.

Thanks for the info.

Still wondering... do you have a pre-latest-improvement model and a
latest model, or a real and a Neobike Brompton?

You won't of course ride it around first, and scuff the case a little to
give the impression that it is not a new import when you go through
Customs...

Hmmm, not massively cheap, but still a worth while saving.  Bargaining
seems to be part of the system in HK.  I can live with that!

I can use some airmiles and pop over for a short holiday some time. The
Brompton will easily go in luggage (buy that there too!) for the return
trip.

Thanks for the info.

Of course not. No way. No chance. Not at all. Well, yes, actually. :-)

I have a five mile ride to work. Downhill nearly all the way at speeds 
of between 20 and 30mph. Only a couple of gentle uphill bits. Takes 
about 15 minutes and is great fun.  The ride back is 25 minutes of slog 
at 6-10mph.  The Zap turns this into easier 2nd gear work with speeds of 
more like 10-12mph.  I've ridden it with Zap broken and it MUCH more 
civilised with the assist.

So overall I'm happy and I feel it's worth the extra weight.

Problems
1) Friction drive is crude and slips in the wet.  OK about 6-8mph (wheel 
speed closer to motor speed) but like really bad clutch slip below this.
2) Heavy. Lead acid is bomb proof, but roll on NiMH!!!
3) The kit has needed some running repairs. Bolts need more threadlock, 
things need adjusting, roller swapped for new one, wires frayed and 
needed replacing.
4) The motor doesn't help above 12-14 mph, so for gentle uphills it's 
legwork!
5) Ben isn't doing it anymore! Distributor stopped supplying; new one 
now stepped in, but Ben's working on something new.

If his new system is as good as it seems like it could be I will 
upgrade!

Ian- I'm not sure if that was you in another post talking about switching to derailleurs in the hope of finding higher gears.  Whoever it was, keep in mind that for the same max chain ring in front and minimum cog in back, the internally geared 5 speed hub will give 40 some percent higher overall gearing.  This is partly why internal gears dominate small wheeled bikes, from folders to small wheel recumbents.

I would assume it prevents damage to the brake caliper if you accidentally twist the handle bars too far around.

Yes, twas me. It's probably best if everyone ignores me while I go off and do 
some research on what gearing the various options will actually provide.  The 
mountain drive sounds more and more tempting!

Good, that seems to justify my decision to drop the Zap! My 
general impression was that it was pretty good, but didn't last very 
long in serious use. The Heinzmann-Brompton is now off the 
drawing board, but it's an expensive beast - 900 to do the 
conversion. But is it the best electric motor there is...

PS NiMH is on the way (but it does have 1/3 the lifespan of NiCad).

Not so accidentally, it's part of the folding process.  There's a two
inch space between the frame and the top of my brake.  That would make
quite a bend in the brake cable.  But I have an Alesa dual pivot brake.

Yes. The ones talked about are fitted to my bike and the rear has gone to a
replaceable level in about 1,000 miles of (albeit hard) riding. The front is
still OK.

In that time I have had five punctures (the three in on day reported in A-B,
all glass fragments on rainy day), one pressure puncture front wheel falling
down one of London's deep potholes, and one glass somewhere else (Rotherham,
I think). 

Although this may sound like a lot of punctures, I reckon it is about half
that of the Records doing a similar amount of inner-city cycling. In my
opinion, the Schwalbe has less rolling resistance at high pressures, but is
quite hard on the wrists as a result.

Haven't decided what to fit next. Maybe the new Brompton (Primos) although I
like the grip of the Schwalbes.

Best wishes.

Martin.

That lifespan roughly equates with my experience.  I reckon I've done a
little over a thousand miles on the Schwalbes (on relatively good roads
though - Kew to the City and back).  The front one is fine of course;
it's the rear that gave up.  But in fairness to Herr Schwalbe I weigh
nearly 200 lbs so the rear wheel on my Brompton is heavily loaded - I
had to have it rebuilt to stop the spokes breaking.

The good news is that I had no punctures in either tyre until I had to
replace the rear.  I too thought I was a tread separation victim until I
looked more closely and saw the cover grinning through the tread in
places.

I reckon a rear tyre on my MTB typically lasts 4000-5000 miles (though
usually the tyre wall breaks down before the tread wears through).  I've
forgotten how to do the trig to calculate the effective length of a 16"
tyre compared to a 26" tyre, but I would guess it's in the region of
between 2:1 and 3:1.  And given that on an MTB the weight is more evenly
distributed between front and back wheels, perhaps the equivalent
lifespan isn't so bad after all.

Please tell more about this Heinzmann, is that the 3 phase motor?



Regarding another post, the ratio of circumference between a 16 and 26 inch wheel is 1.625 to 1.

There's lots more info on the website (www.kinetics.org.uk). The 
Heinzmann is DC, I think you're thinking of the Rabbit Tools motor, 
which is AC - I haven't heard much about that yet, but as soon as 
it's available I'd like to try it. At present, the Heinzmann is the best 
there is (for both durability and power) and it is a tried and tested 
design - we build about 4 bikes per week with it and I wouldn't use 
anything else. I haven't had to fix one yet, either!

Nothing has broken since that bracket. Now I've got past the teething 
troubles it's pretty good. But it's still a bit of a Heath-Robinson 
approach!

Perhaps next year!  What's involved in fitting it?

The Panasonics used in hybrid vehicles are said to last the life of the 
vehicle. This is with very careful use and charging, though.

And by a strange coincidence this is also the ratio of their diameters, 
and I've just noticed also their radii!  What an odd world we live in. 
:-)

When working out the speed various Heinzmann hubs would give with 16" 
wheels I used the 1.6(ish) factor twice. Once for 26" vs. 16" and once 
for kph v6. mph.

Or combine them to get 2.6   So for 13mph with 16" you need something 
rated at about 34kph with 26".

Your paper on the subject is not approved for publication. You merely
divided 26 by 16, you cheat!  Aren't we good enough for precision?  We
want the ration of the exact diameters of the tyres at their optimal
pressure, averaged over their life span.  You may ignore the expansion
of the tyres due to centrifugal forces.

Despite the tales of woe I recently fitted a pair of Schwalbes to my 
Brompton. This was to some extent forced by the lack of Brompton 
tyres on the day I needed them. However I am told that these are 
from "the third batch" and may be improved from the original ones. 
That's the feeling they have from recent reports anyway.

I'll let people know how they go.

ps I discovered this morning that the Brompton light bracket will not 
support a B&M Lumotec plus light indefinitely. One side of the spade 
bit that fits over the brake rod has broken and the whole thing fell off. 
The light is I suppose twice the weight of the original one. Any 
suggestions for a replacement.

I still ride pre-production samples. In more than one year they did over 6000 km. Even on the rear wheel tread is visible. I had 6 punctures on the rear wheel, less than half compared to Records and nothing compared to Primos

I experienced the same and got a similar part from my LBS. It's from steel

Stein, I fear you may be expanding due to something other than centrifugal forces.  Maybe you should go ride your bike awhile.

CHRONOS HAMMER

Here is another interesting electric motor system that we heard about, but
could find little in the way of "user feedback".  The ability to use one of
these on a particular folder is in doubt, but it otherwise looks intriguing.

Excuses excuses !

I'm 192 + 7 + 42 max - 241 lbs although mine havent had that treatment.

Not had that problem.

Today, I've blown it up to 100 psi. It expanded that much, that it rubbed on
the mudguard. I investigated. Turns out that when I put the wheel back in,
the axle was resting on the frame rather than the stepped washers. I must
say it's a bit of a design weakness considering wheel replacement should be
a diy affair - i.e. easy for idiots to do. I guess I should have
investigated the soft tightening effect of the nuts it created. I will also
say that one of the nuts was only finger tight (the one under the tensioner)
despite tightening firmly when I put the wheel in.

It harks back to my first rear wheel out and in - those stepped washers were
fairly well wedged in which is why I wasn't overly concerned about the poor
tightening feeling.

Anybody else had problems like this ?

If you want precision, that ratio is nearer 0.615 to 1.

I've seen a Presto with Edgar Tromm in AMS but wondered if anyone's tried one 
yet.  

They claim 17.6lb which is slighltly better than a Primo equipped Micro-Lite, 
with other weight reduction features, but it doesn't seem to have mudguards, 
or any facility for luggage or lighting - maybe OK for CA commuting but not 
for UK/EU

Guess its one of those numbers like -- Pi, or the value of the UK to the US$.

> AC on a bike ?

Yup. It is theoretically possible, but DC to AC inverters are 
generally big heavy inefficient things - Rabbit tools claim they've 
solved these problems. I'm reserving my healthy skepticism until I 
can try one...

Fitting the Heinzmann is trickier than the Zap - you need to fit new 
forks which are wider to take the hub. The battery goes on the front 
luggage block (although I am considering other places to put it) and 
there's a twistgrip on the handlebar to control the throttle.

The Chronos Hammer is interesting - no-one I know of is importing 
them into the UK so I have yet to see one in the flesh. But it's still 
a friction drive - not good :-)

I've just joined this list and haven't noticed any mention of FAQs so hope
no one minds me asking what may be questions with obvious answers.
I'm thinking of touring France soon with my Brompton for the first time as I
quite like the idea of being able to take the bike with me on all trains
without having to wait for it to arrive separately at the other end. I'm
wondering if others have experience of the feasibility of this - how is it
for carrying luggage up to 60miles/day etc? I've already spent some time
putting a home made rear carrier on and making gearing modifications with
smaller 42/32 front chain rings and a low tech oily finger gear changer to
select between them. Also some fairly basic questions like what are good
bags to strap on front and back, what is the best place/way to attach water
bottles and what weight can one safely carry on the front block and frame?

TIA

    You did such a great job with the FAQ, now you should find out why your

Hello Krip,

In addition to the FAQ, (which should be called (L)FAQ to incorporate
the indispensable Less Frequently Asked Questions) I can tell you from
our experience that your plans are quite feasible. Take care to choose a
setup that can be carried easily from platform to platform when changing
trains. For us, this means the Brompton Bag on the front luggage block
(carrying ca. 5 kg), and a cylindrical "weekender bag" strapped to the
rear carrier (with another 9 kg). This is enough for camping gear,
clothes etc. Water bottles go into the back pockets of the front bag. 60
miles/day sounds quite excessive, but we're no athletes.
If you happen to be in the Provence by the end of September, you might
find us Bromptoneering the hills around there.

Have a nice trip,

Nico

I look forward to seeing it.  But I'll need to get another six months out 
of the Zap really. Might get a bonus in March. :-)

BTW My battery is starting to go flat after five miles. It used to do the 
whole trip. Getting tired?

> AC on a bike ?

Yup. It is theoretically possible, but DC to AC inverters are
generally big heavy inefficient things -

I know it's possible, but it seems quite silly considering any good speed
controlled motors are generlly DC driven from generators driven by AC motors
(in the big world).

And just why are DC-AC converters called "inverters" - what have they turned
upside down ?

Brompton rate the front block at 12 Kg - we have carried at least 24Kg but 
now fit a plate which backs up the 2, 4mm screws with a clamping bolt behind 
the steerer tube.  One iten which will tie on to the Brompton or other 
carrier frame is the York 80 watertight box for white water sports, it will 
float with 80lbs payload, and is conveniently EXACTLY the maximum size for 
carry-on baggage in that little box at the check-in.  

The rear carrier will carry 1 average size adult - say 70Kg.  We currently 
use Sainsbury scan and shop boxes with lids which are waterproof but not 
watertight (ie will sink eventually if chucked into river).

If Stein wants pictures I'll get round to scanning some over for FAQ.

I'm puzzled by the sheer number of people who seem to need lower gearing - 
are they not pumping the tyres up enough? are their brakes binding? the 
standard Brompton is decidedly undergeared IMO, and a chainring up to 64 
teeth can be fitted, although the 13 tooth rear cogs don't last long that way.

I suspect 30-60 is my normal range - over 60 I run into 3 problems:

My legs won't go that fast;
I can't put any power on;
my feet slip on the pedals;
I lose balance.

IMO only undergeared at the top end. Although it's easily wheelied in 1 and
2, 1 is needed for steeper hills - and I haven't really managed to get off
the saddle for hill climbing due to handlebars in the way.

I guess because AC consists of negative voltages as well as 
positive...

A to B had a good article about motors a few issues back.  As I recall,
the stall torque of a 3 phase motor is higher and current draw is
lower.  DC motors on bikes have a cutout switch that keeps them off at
low speeds, which is often when they are most needed.  Otherwise they
tend to burn up.

Electric bicycles do seem like a promising field.  I guess I'll wait for
a non friction drive AC motor on the front so I can still have the gears
in back.

Actually one can develop more power at higher speeds, but slipping off
the pedals is a problem.  When I have cleats on my pedals I often exceed
100 rpm climbing hills on my recumbent if I'm trying to go quickly.  I
believe you'll find that professional racers tend to stay above 80 rpm
most of the time, except when they run out of low enough gears.  Then
they stand up.

It does take a while to build up to those cadences, but there are real
advantages for the cartilage in one's knees.  I have several friends who
quit riding due to knee problems, but have succeeded in returning to
biking by staying above 80 rpm.

I suspect this is why there is so much interest in lower gears for the
Brompton.  But there are other reasons: I just biked 12 miles along a
hilly route with 153 pounds of groceries from my buying club in the
trailer.  I would have liked even lower gears for that.

That's why the Heinzmann is so good - the motor itself runs at a 
pretty high RPM, but the internal gearbox gears it down for road 
use. It's impossible to stall the things - believe me, I've tried!

I've always been built like a weight-lifter and not a sprinter. I'm sure
things have seriously improved since I started aerobics about 4 years ago.
Before I can pedal like buggery, I've got to get the heart to withstand it,
the lungs/diaphragm to cope and all the furry bits in between. I daresay I'm
doing a lot better now than I was.

Secondly, I cycle for pleasure, not to race. I don't do many miles in a day,
a few here, a few there. Had I been looking at >50 miles per day, it would
be a different bike, feet attached to pedals and likely the higher cadences.
As it's not, the gearing on the standard T5 is fine for me although 5th
could do with being higher. It's maybe why the "wide" gearing is fine for me
and not for the fast pedallers. For them, it makes a big jump between
ratios. After a tiring climb, I'll pedal in a lower gear and fast while I
get my breath back.

Mike.

I guess because AC consists of negative voltages as well as
positive...


Nah, I don't think (hope not !) it's that after all, they don't class AC as
having a polarity.

I would tend to agree that 25 mph is around my stability limit on the Brompton, though I have certainly gone faster on occasion.

As far as ground speed versus cadence, I can give you rough numbers for the "reduced gearing".  I go about 8 mph at 80rpm in first gear and somewhere close to 20 mph in 5th gear.  I have maintained 25mph in 5th gear but I believe that has me spinning over 100 rpm.  95 rpm or so is about my comfort limit for long periods, say 30 minutes or more.  Very hard to exceed 120 rpm without cleats or toe clips.

Are you saying you can hit full throttle from a dead stop without abusing the battery?

Sure is, for example normal mains AC(UK) is a sign wave (50hz), Root Mean
Square 240V
So 3 phase is  the same amplitide but  3 hases it is 440v
It's 25 years since I did any of this so it's only a vague and probably
inaccurate explanation

Hmm... I've seen you abduct Linette Chiang at Folder Forum III, but I
bet she's under 50kg.  A girl who cannot weigh more than 70kg (I
couldn't ask, obviously) once placed her foot on mine, without fully
standing on it, and already one of the stays broke.  I broke once of the
four bars by misplacing my foot while the bike was folded.

Yuck... that's the only time when I want a high gear to pedal very
slowly.  I'd rather rest but this way I tell myself 'm stimulating blood
circulation and not freezing and such, while still pooring a bit of
energy into the bike.

FWIW the nomenclature of inverter often means change DC to AC whilst 
converter changes AC to DC.

The names reflect what the circuit does; it inverts the applitude of the 
voltage at a fixed frequency continuously in cycles.  In DC to AC, a sine 
wave oscillator is designed that can deliver current, and amplitude 
[voltage].  The combo of current capability and voltage together is power, 
so often these devices are called power inverters.  Non-sine wave voltages 
work too, with less efficiency.

Think of how it works as a battery powered mono music amplifier playing a 
60Hz pure tone delivering that sound into any type of speaker, from 2-16 
ohms.  The 'sound' is the AC, how much volume this delivers is ~ power.

The simplest AC-DC converter rectifies AC into pulsed DC, then smoothens it 
with capacitors.  You can use the whole cycle, or parts of it, these are 
the typical brick power supplies from Radio Shack.  You could also use 
complex methods, such as in switching regulators used in desktop computers, 
its more expensive but more efficient, generates less heat.  With so many 
ways to convert AC-DC, conversion is often used to term its transformation.

The RMS voltage doesn't describe polarity, but its a working means to 
define voltage in calculations since in AC, the average on one cycle = 0 [ 
peak and through negate each other yet AC can pack a whallop.]  That 
whallop is Root Mean Square voltage which, avoiding a detailed discussion, 
could be looked at as the equivalent of what ACV does in DC circuit.  THe 
RMS voltage voltage, for sine waves about 0.707 of the peak AC voltage, can 
be used accurately say in Ohms law.

Hopefully, if you buys such devices for a bike, the names for have some 
deeper meaning, but knowing how they work doesn't help much except the 
parameters that affect cyclists: conversion efficiency, weight, size and 
cost of the device.  In general, cheap light weight low power applications 
are DC powered because they're simpler to construct.  High power 
applications shine in AC.  That's all we need know folks!

I find the gears ok for Cardiff...which is fairly flat overall(5spd L5, s/n
143834).I find there doesn't seem to be much difference between 1st and
2nd...the extra mechanical resistance of first gear seems to negate any
benefit of the lower 1st speed.I have been monitoring speed and it seems you
can maintain a speed of around 21/22 mph IF there is no headwind and you are
feeling fairly fit(don't know what pedal rpm this is,sorry).
I wouldn't agree the Brompton gets unstable over 25 mph...I regularly exceed
30 mph on a small downill stretch when going to the supermarket and the bike
seems quite happy....saying that, I haven't had any wobbles yet!

Hi,

I was looking on the Brompton Homepage (looking much better now than the
old design!) for the User Manual as downloadable .PDF file.  No luck,
though.

Anyone by any chance has one digitally?

Browsing their website I find it rather unfriendly to not even post a
contact form or a simple eMail-address - well, if they did it is not easy
to find, I could find one at least.  :-/

Believable (as a source of the name), perhaps "inverter" is a shortened
version of the full name.

Agreed. I tend to use 1st for a subway ramp for better control round 180
bends. I also found it useful when carrying an extra 3st weight - the
additional friction is less noticeable.

I've found locking out the elbows helps a lot - but this does mean staying
rather upright, and when you're going downhill quickly, being in a more
racing position is where you want to be - hence bent elbows ! In such
situations, it's decidedly unstable - and rather scary.

If I understand this correctly what an inverter does is take dc current steady
+ve polarity say 12v to AC  which  Cycles +20ish to -20ish if the RMS voltage
is 12v. So the AC potential varies between +ve and -ve with the inversion
occuring to create the lower half of the sine wave.

Yes, more accurately with RMS = [.707 * ACV] for a pure sine wave, I 
omitted saying ACV used is peak voltage.

RMS =~ DCV in a "resistive" circuit [meaning its effect is considered in 
relation to the effect on Ohms law Voltage = Current * Resistance], then 
14DCV =~ 14Vrms ~= 20ACV peak.

For more info see:

http://www.traceengineering.com/technical/tech_notes/tn2.html


By your example if +Ve = 20V, and -Ve=20 V then, peak voltage = 20V, peak 
to peak = 40V.

Wobbles occur mainly as steering geometry alters to reduce the trail - with 
small wheels this is more rapildy changed that with large wheels.  Perhaps as 
you go faster you put weight forward, and thus create what bikers over here 
know as a tank slapper.

Sitting back and transferring weight rearwards will increase the trail and a 
wobble can be enhance or removed - especially if you have a fairly weighty 
backpack on to make weight transfer of considerable effect.

I lock my elbows in that bent position, and steer from my shoulders, using 
this 'natural' handlebar extension to provide a modest lever of stability.

Hi!
I have owned the same Brompton since 1994 and I have just returned from
holidays in Europe.
The two major problems I have with the bike are:
the hook. The front part of the bike is supposed to be held in place by this
hook but it is now seriously bent. No matter how much I try to adjust it,
the front half of the bike slips out of place. Very awkward when your
lugging a lot off luggage - off a train, for example.
the loose rear.  When the bike is heavily loaded, the rear tends to drop
down, much like a stubborn mule, and the bike is immobilised.  You run
across the road with the bike, reach the kerb and the thing upends.
Has anybody come up with a hook to stop the rear doing this?
Best
tim

If the hook on the front mudguard stay can truly no longer be adjusted by bending it you may have to buy a new stay...

I've made a hook to keep up the rear end of the bike, because I carry my luggage on the back of the Brompton.
I took a 4mm thick iron rod (with a plastic outer cover) which is bent to go around the seatpost, then slightly to the rear, and then projects downwards and forms a hook around the top bit of the rear triangle, near the rubber suspension block. No scratching of seatpost/triangle because of the plastic outer layer.
I've made the hook just tight enough to grip the triangle when I'm not sitting on the bike. Unhooking the rear can easily be done when the suspension block is compressed a bit (sitting or leaning on the saddle).

If utterly unclear I could send a picture off list to those in need.

The hook that holds the front wheel? If you bend it back to the shape 
that it was originally then it should hold the front wheel in place. 

It may be that the disc that is locked in place by the seat post has 
moved. This holds the whole thing together and if it is not in the 
right place may allow the front wheel to unfold.

Custom folder do a purpose designed one. Others use dog gollars, 
leather straps and all sorts of other things.

I hope this sort of question is not out of order for the list.

I shall take delivery of my new L5 tomorrow. My plan is to use it to get to
from work (4 miles) and when travelling by train, but then to fold it up in
the boot of the car and use it to cycle in interesting places. My question
is how robust/comfortable is the Brompton off tarmac? I'm not considering
mountain-bike terrain, but I would like to follow the odd wooded path.

Thanks.
martin

Thanks for the prompt reply.
I seem to be having difficulties in getting the thing into proper shape -
and the situation is made worse by the outer plastic peeling away.
As I said in my earlier post, my Brompton - five gears, dynamo and carrier
back and front - was bought in the summer of ninety four and I've been very
happy with it.
In the last six years, have there been any changes to this, the top model?
Best

Because its rear is suspended, (and the handle bar flexes), it is more 
comfortable than some MTBs.  I've taken it on canal paths, gravel-ly roads 
and other types OK.  Of course the 16" wheels don't take potholes well.  And 
they get bogged down in anything (dirt, gravel, sand) deep or loose.  But any 
fairly firm, smooth surface shouldn't pose a problem (unlike, say, 
cobblestones).

I agree.  And to stop your wrists getting shaken invest in some Bio-grip
handlebar grips - quite pricey but very comfortable, got mine from Cyclecare
in Blythe Road, West London.

Off road the bike is overtly dangerous when any surface into which 
the front wheel can suddenly sink or on a slippery surface - it will 
throw you over the handlebars or slide you straight off as the tyres 
are too narrow & too hard to cope with these conditions. In the 
second case it is hopeless in ice & sloshy snow & slippery wet road 
surfaces such as cobbles & on metal inspection covers.

You will get the tyres cut to shreds & spend life repairing punctures 
on gravel chip paths/tracks. If, as Sustrans recommend councils, 
crushed limestone is used that is fine. It compacts & drains well and 
does not have sharp edges on any size chip. Therefore you need to 
know your track before you cycle it - defeats the object tho'!.

I brought this up sometime a go but never got much feedback.

How do people deal with punctures? 

I sometimes get the impression that most respondents on this list 
accept them as fact of life - I cannot - I don't expect to get any 
punctures in my car tyres in a 30-40Kmile life - why should I settle 
for less on my bike?

Does Kevlar tape or belted wheels PREVENT punctures? If not why pay 
the extra cost?

Does anyone use slime? Is it any good?

I have resported to plastic tape, which over a period of time, but 
much less infrequently than penetrations, either rubs through the 
tube longtitutinally or across the join depending on the make. To 
prevent this I fillet old tubes & wrap them around the new tube 
before inserting it into the tyre - this is very bulky & needs talc 
or french chalk between them.

What are other peoples views or solutions or are my expectations of 
cycling as a reliable mode of transport too high?

Quite a few, but possibly not the hook. I'm sure if you ask a dealer 
they will be able to get a new hook for it.

These are a problem on any bike with sensible tyres for a road. The 
tyre can make a great difference though.

My experience is that bike-commuting is like that.  I've even gotten 
punctures right next to my 'Mr Tuffy' tape on one bike.  Am trying to keep a 
record, but seems like every month, on one bike or another.  

But then my truck -- no punctures, but -- used to need air for soft tires 
every two weeks, despite going to the wheel shop often.  At least I can pump 
up the bike at home.

I've had:

A damaged rim (pothole#);
A broken rear luggage carrier*
Bent rear luggage carrier, bent rim and broken spoke$

# The Council paid for a complete new front wheel.
* National Express discovered this fails when the folded bike was thrown at
one of their coaches. They paid for the replacement after they received a
summons.
$ The _VERY_ rear end was hit by a car at 90 after coming out of a side
road. Rear carrier stays pushed into the side of the rear wheel prevented
wheel rotation and I slid to a halt !

Having said that, the bike is strong, I've not had any failures due to weak
bike despite riding the bike on all terrains.

Comfort wise, it's fine.

Give slippery surfaces the respect they deserve. Don't use Brompton's
own-brand tyres, they're seriously gripless on wet surfaces - and I'd
include normal road surfaces in the range.

In the

I can't imagine it fairing any worse than typical tyres (i.e. not mtb).
Again, avoid Brompton's own brand tyre.

I've only had cuts due to glass with mine.

Indeed - Records are good on slippery surfaces, Bromptons are appalling.

Probably not significantly, but obviously worse than larger diameter wheels
which climb out of the ruts they create with greater ease. I did find it
hard work pedalling across a mown grass field, but far from impossible. I've
been through off-road muddy puddles with mine - the main thing is to keep
going, so a little momentum before hitting the soft stuff is very useful.

But any

I've not had a problem with cobblestones, although the ones I've ridden over
are possibly "setts" i.e. flat-ish topped ones.

Last winter I rode my MTB to work with cheapo heavy-duty tyres and slime
tubes (the pre-filled ones), being fed up with many punctures.  Probably
over-kill, but I didn't get any more punctures!  The slime tubes are heavy,
and it was a relief to get away from this combination when drier days
arrived and I bought some lighter quality tires.

The only puncture I got in a slime tube was from a spoke nipple - which the
slime is useless to protect as it's on the inside.

Not used slime on the Brompton though.

Phil

Andrew Henry's dead right about this with his 4 rules. I do about 7 miles a
day on Primos mostly in central London and (tempting the puncture Gods here)
I've not had a flat for as long as I can remember, at least a year.

Pump them up hard, get a track pump, mine cost 20 GBP. Especially the back
as it carries more weight. Helps to avoid pinch punctures and I'm sure makes
it harder for sharp objects to penetrate.

I regard any puncture repair as temporary and replace the tube asap.

Watch where you ride, avoid potholes and other bumps with sharp edges and
rubbish in the gutter. I never ride very near the curb anyway.

When I bought the Primos, the LBS sold me some very skinny tubes which
flatted 3 times in the first week. Replaced them with some a lot thicker
(and heavier), only 1 puncture since - about 2 years. Fit them very
carefully, make sure there's no dirt or grit inside the tyre cover and try
to do it without using levers.

Cheers,
Ron Colverson

In 18 months, my front Record has NOT had a puncture. (Sorry, forgot the
snakebite which required a new wheel !)

Are punctures a rear wheel phenomenon in general ? Could it be

Mine have always been glass - a big city phenomenon.

Certainly makes the ride a lot harder !

 When you have a nice pump, its quick and

Sort those leaks out !!!!

Totally agree that it's very important for the solution to dry properly
before applying the patch. Rushing patching is a waste of time and if you're
out in the wet, you tend to rush things ! Indoors, not only is it easier to
make a clean surface, the warmth helps the solution to dry - and why not
make a coffee and drink it while waiting !

I'm puzzled about this one, have you any proof whatsoever ?

> How do people deal with punctures?

I've not done a roadside repair. My "recent" punctures have either been
walking ditance from home or the bike shop ! I've only had one puncture
miles from anywhere. There was me and my racer - no tools or anything ! I
walked/wheeled the bike a few miles to a main road. I waited for no cars,
then threw the bike over a wall. I then walked along the road towards home,
and got a lift from someone I knew. I then took my van back for the bike.

I've never felt that desperate to carry repair equipment, although I do
sometimes now. I guess I'd favour a spare tube rather than roadside puncture
repairs - for all the obvious reasons.

So get thick tyres for the bike then ! No, might as well get foam rubber
ones that don't require compressed air in them.

I've not had enough punctures per mile to rate cycling as unreliable. What's
the cause of your punctures, and how can you avoid them ?

Cheers ! - thanks for the reminder ! Now that I've blown the Marathon up
properly, the rear wheel diameter increase made that disc require
adjusting - so now I've dunnit. Are you aware that the new models have
concentric discs so are unadjustable !

I can't remember a flat in the last 6000 miles or so, but I ride mostly
rural and always with liners or kevlar.  I also would like to see bikes
as reliable as cars, but keep in mind the trade off between rolling
resistance and puncture resistance.   You can afford to waste a lot more
power pushing fat inefficient tires with a gas engine than you can
afford with your legs and heart, so bike tires tend to be thinner
considering the load and pressure.

Well said. I feel that people accepting high failure rates on bikes is 
what has kept reliability down. I have to take a spanner to my bike far 
more often than my car. And on my car I have details of torque settings 
for every bolt. Local bike shop laughed at me when I asked if there was 
a Brompton manual with torque settings!  But Brompton themselves must 
specify torques to the manufacturers.

Anyway, I recently switches from Primos to Brompton Kevlars. No 
punctures yet, but it's only been three weeks.

I have a short and almost unavoidable stretch of cobbles on my way to 
work. In the wet, and after I've had to ride through the diesel the 
buses spill, they are very scary! It's like riding on lumpy, greased 
snot!

Buy Schwalbes and keep them close to 100psi. 

On two T5's together, rural + town:
  Records:  11000 km, 9 punctures
  Schwalbes: 5000 km, 1 puncture

They wear a bit quicker, are more expensive, but also have less rolling
resistance, and able to take dynamo's.

Depends what one is doing. On a leisure ride a puncture is a way of 
relieving the monotony of riding along with nothing to achieve:-) 
More seriously it's not too much of a problem, just part of an 
enjoyable day.

On a business ride a puncture is more of a nuisance. One way of 
avoiding them is to avoid the sort of cycle ghettos councils like to 
provide. This also avoids the spreading of leaf mulch onto one's 
shoes.

Solutions to business punctures, catch a train, bus or taxi and sort 
it out later. Take another vehicle that day. Take the thing to a shop 
and get them to fix it. Disposable plastic gloves. Spare tube.

As others have pointed out it's possible to reduce cycle punctures to 
zero, at the cost of much harder work. There are "solid" tyres, like 
those fitted to some models of the Bike Hod. It's a matter of 
compromise.

> Does anyone use slime? Is it any good?

It's useful with the right tyres. It needs a fair amount in the tube 
to be most effective. This will damage the side wall of thin walled 
tyres like the Primo over time due to bumps. Raleigh Records work 
fine with it, no idea about the newer tyres. After a serious burst 
the tube needs to be retired for a while for the goo to dry fully 
before it can be repaired.

Interesting!  I got my Brompton 2nd hand and maybe missed out on a few 
bits. 

BTW The torque for the bolt that holds on the chain tensioner is 5nm! 
No wonder I broke it. :-(  My torque wrench doesn't go this low - that 
really is a low torque setting.

Unless I am mistaken, the Brompton was conceived in Cambridge.
The only time in six years that I have ever had to pay for taking my bike on
public transport was in Cambridge, when travelling to Stansted.
Other bags going into the hold of the bus were bigger than mine but the
conductor, seeing the wheels of the Brompton, insisted I pay an extra five
pounds. I was already paying - I believe - eleven pounds for myself.
There's now a train service to Stansted from Cambridge.

As has been said the settings are in the manual, which comes with new 
Bromptons (or at least did and I guess this hasn't changed). The 
manual has been criticised for being too technical:-)

If you ask nicely someone might even look up the figures you want.

"With the backing of a few friends, Andrew turned his bedroom into a 
workshop and began the painstaking task of building prototypes. A 
flat in central London, however spacious, was hardly the ideal place 
to design and build a bicycle, but the congested streets below, and 
the narrow stairway into the flat, provided the necessary impetus to 
drive down the size of the folded package. The locality helped in 
other ways too. A mile to the east or west, and the new bicycle might 
have been known as the Kensington, the Belgravia, or even the 
Pimlico, but living above the Brompton Road, a stone's throw from the 
Brompton Oratory, the designer settled on Brompton."

The story is that the designer lived in a flat on Brompton Road in West
London at the time he was developping the prototype, using wooden mockups I
believe.

    I carry both a spare tube and a patch kit together (I know I will NEVER
find an 18" presta tube for my Birdy on the road).  When flat, I use the
spare tube.  The patch kit would serve for serial punctures (it does happen
;)  ).  I've cut a small rectangle from a (free) Federal Express Tyvek
mailing envelope for tyre cut reinforcement (a tyre "boot" I think it's
called).  The stuff is as strong as Kevlar.   I also carry a $20 bill for a
taxi cab emergency.  I've gotten a few rides from people and never needed
the taxi money.  I suppose the folded Birdy looks like I've been in some
sort of horrible accident (perhaps a restaurant "sample size" ketchup
container could be carried to make this effect even more realistic ;)

    90% of my punctures are due to a nasty local weed called "puncture vine"
(for obvious reasons).  Looks like a pea-size mine with protruding spikes:
very nasty!

    I used slime once.  Got a puncture from, of all things, a golf tee (the
little wooden thingy that holds a golf ball erect when you hit it).  The
hole was so large that the slime didn't work to save the tube going flat.
Back then I didn't carry a spare tube and the repair was frustratingly
difficult because the slimy goo kept coming out, preventing a patch from
holding.  After 2 or 3 tries, I finally got one to hold long enough for me
to get home.  Also, the slime adds a LOT of weight to the tire.

    I don't like using the small glue tubes that come with patch kits.  Once
you open them, even though you only need a small bit for the repair, the
glue will inevitably be dried out and useless the next time you need it.  I
just put on my spare tube and carry the flat one home.  When I've
accumulated a small batch of tubes to repair I do them all at once using a
large bottle of glue (cheap, doesn't dry out) in the comfort of my garage.

    As the puncture vine is seasonal, I find myself doing repairs only once
during a few months of the year that I get these sort of flats.

    Birdy has a new Kevlar tyre which I've put on my rear wheel.  I'm
curious to see if that will make a difference regarding punctures.

        Cheers,

            Bob  (near San Francisco)

It doesn't dry out in our mild temperate UK climate.  Can be carrried around
over here for a couple of years, albeit with noticeable viscosity increase.

I did use Slime but got so fed up with the leaky mess that ensued whenever I needed to take the wheel out (for greasing bearings, etc) that in the end I threw the tube away.  Plus the extra weight slopping around at the periphery of the wheel did nothing for the wheel's balance.  The manufacturer's claim that it would evenly distribute itself around the tube doesn't seem to hold at North of Scotland temperatures.

I can thoroughly endorse the use of a track pump.  Get a version that does Schrader and Presta valves automatically, however - on my old Specialized pump it was a terrible fiddle taking out the chuck innards and reversing them all the time.  Plus get a big gauge.  They may be expensive, but it means you can get away with cheapie pocket pumps for emergency on bike use.

I manage very well on the local forestry tracks.  And that's using Primos.  The small wheels are liable to be deflected by stones and can run aground in soft surfaces, but if you're not in a hurry  
this isn't a problem.

> I regard any puncture repair as temporary and replace the tube asap.

I've found new tubes are worse for going down due to dirt in the valves.
Also, I guess you haven't realised that all tubes have punctures and are
repaired by sticking a valve-patch on them !

1) the front wheel retaining hook - fashioned by an extra bend in the 
mudguard stay - always bends and loses shape.  I have made a solid hook by 
adapting a bracket (IIRC from a car roof rack or shelf support) which has a 
detent that locates in the front dropout, and a hole for the front axle.  
This has been the solution, and avoids the wiggly about bit of mudguard stay 
the other system has, when the wheel is out.

2) the rear retaining strap clips in and out in seconds, and holds the back 
up, although some users with heavy loads have found the rubber compresses 
sufficiently to disengage the unit, and may also stretch the webbing - we are 
trying to resolve that detail.

3) an alternative to the plastic thingy is to modify the thick part of an 
Adie handlebar mounted front light bracket -  from the days when all bik 
lighs fitted onto a simple standard bracket, the dimensions of which probably 
were standardised on the old oil lanterns used on horse drawn carriages.  
This conveniently curved part will locate against the seat tube and generally 
stay in place.

I was trying to service the headset bearing last night which I've not done
before. I slackened the 6mm allen screw revealed by folding the handlebars
down and then hit the screw quite hard with a rod and hammer but the steerer
and forks remained locked together. Am I doing something wrong or do I need
to just hit it even harder? I'm a bit worried about bruising the headset
cups and cones with such brute force.
TIA

Make sure you hit the bottom of the allen bolt, not the top (i.e. use 
a drift which is smaller than a 6mm allen key, or use the key itself) -
 otherwise you can damage the bolt. It does need quite a lot of 
force, and once you've tapped the bolt down you may also need to 
wrench the steerer sideways. Stand in front of the bike and hold 
the front wheel with your feet, then twist the bars.

Fair point, but another patch is just one more weak link to let you down.
Have you never had a repair you've done start to leak? Not even once?

Carrying a patch kit and a tube with a full sized bike has the benefit that
if the puncture is to the rear wheel and easily identified, it's often
possible to effect a repair without removing the wheel (less of an issue
obviously with front wheel). But can this ever be managed on a bike with 16"
wheels?

Thanks for the input on punctures - very depressing! I just cannot 
understand why people are happy to put up with it. I also feel 
suitabley chastised as at least one respondent thinks it's my fault!

I take some peoples views regarding surfaces but there is no choice.

As for all the useful & helpful preparations for failure - well, I 
think it confirms my view that Brompton cycling is inherently 
unreliable & the reliability issue is only important for me.

This was confirmed yesterday when the rear sprocket fractured & I 
lost all my drive when I was expecting to do a 30 mile journey.

Since new in April 1999 & 4650 miles the history is:-
1 - Totally inadequate brakes & broken cable until suitable blocks 
found.
2 - 30-40 punctures.
3 - Split rear wheel rim
4 - fractured handlebars.
5 - now the sprocket.

Perhaps that's why people use cars.

But we've had two Bromptons for over ten years and have had absolutely no
trouble at all with them, apart from one broken spoke and a couple of
punctures - the bikes have been used on some fairly poor on-road surfaces in
Ireland and Norway as well as UK and our experience with full-sized bikes
has been less favourable (although difficult to compare because our
full-sized bikes will always get stolen within 5 years, unlike the Brompton)

Well it doesn't have to do a lot !

Of course, you could alway fit the spanner, add a weightless 1m extension to
it and dangle a 5N mass on the end of it.

You mistreat it ?

I m,ust add that I've hit objects with it while cycling which has disformed
it, but it does go back into shape with some appropriate encouragement.

I agree - this is totally unacceptable. But I'd also say totally unusual.
Possible explanations:
a) Badly made example. I can't comment as I've not owned a recent one, I'm
still riding my 1987 L3!
b) You ride in an environment which inflicts huge wear and tear on the B.
c) You treat the bike harshly and unsympathetically.

I'm sorry that Brompton cycling has been inherently unreliable for you but I
assure you that most riders don't have that experience. I wouldn't use mine
for a daily commute if it let me down all the time.

My total milage is approx. 5000, and your list reads just like mine. I only
have to add about a dozen broken spokes (but that issue was solved when the
wheel was rebuild due to the split rim). Also I might add about a dozen more
punctures and a new chain, which I replaced at approx. 3000 miles due to
lenghtening.

Apart from that so far I needed 4 front light brackets. They broke through
vibration. But the lamp is non- original (lumotech standlicht), and might
stress the bracket more than the very light and primitive original. The last
time the bracket broke the lamp fell into the front spokes and was damaged
(albeit still usable).

There were 5 or 6 (lost count) new rear tubes. Four rear tyres (Raleigh, 2x
Primo, Schwalbe)and two front ones, a new right hand pedal (left side is
foldable and appears to be more robust than the rh one). Judging by the
noise it makes the bottom bracket will need attention soon.

If I hadn't done most of the jobs myself (apart from the wheel rebuilding)
I'm convinced that the maintenance cost of the Brompton would be close to or
worse than the maintenance cost of my car. It has a 10 000 mile service
interval, so far no unscheduled stops, and the service cost about 500.- DM
(about 160.- Pound Sterling).

My daughters mountain bike (medium price range) has done a lot more miles
and needed only one set of tyres and the very occasional puncture repair.

Thanks for the input on punctures - very depressing! I just cannot 
understand why people are happy to put up with it. I also feel 
suitabley chastised as at least one respondent thinks it's my fault!

I take some peoples views regarding surfaces but there is no choice.

As for all the useful & helpful preparations for failure - well, I 
think it confirms my view that Brompton cycling is inherently 
unreliable & the reliability issue is only important for me.

This was confirmed yesterday when the rear sprocket fractured & I 
lost all my drive when I was expecting to do a 30 mile journey.

Since new in April 1999 & 4650 miles the history is:-
1 - Totally inadequate brakes & broken cable until suitable blocks 
found.
2 - 30-40 punctures.
3 - Split rear wheel rim
4 - fractured handlebars.
5 - now the sprocket.

Perhaps that's why people use cars.

This issue of reliability unsurprisingly has been well gone over several
times on this list.  The extreme variation in people's experience of
Brompton use is the really interesting fact.  My previous input to this
topic started with the physical aspect of the rider - there is no doubt that
a 14 stone (196lb) rider is going to stress and accelerate wear and tear
much more than a relatively puny individual such as myself who cannot muster
more than 135lbs - like the difference of over half a hundredweight of
luggage which few, in the developped world anyway, would strap onto a
conventional diamonnd frame let alone  a portable bike.
The other highly variable element in these discussions is the range of uses
to which the Brompton bicycle is employed.  I have always regarded it as an
essentially urban machine intended for shorter distance domestic and
commuting purposes.  It is a tribute to the design that it has been used
with apparent success for epic heavily laden camping trips in
wilder parts, but that is not because of intrinsic suitability but because
of the folding which makes it transportable by train or bus.
I too have had a sprocket split (the old 3/32 inch type), loose spokes on
the old steel rims, and quite worn out a few Raleigh Record tyres - but I
have used the machine for almost every working day  in the 11 years that I
have owned it and I can't imagine life without it.  I calculated that I have
spent on maintenance 80 per cent of the cost of a new T5 in this period,
including 2 new handbuilt alloy wheels and a new rear fork assembly which
was also rebushed later.  
I avoid car driving as much as possible, so my meagre 3500 miles of motoring
last year cost a huge whack in fixed overheads, petrol, depreciation, hidden
overheads of pollution, global warming contribution etc . A lot more than 11
years of bike repairs.
It is really sad that people are put off this wonderful bike by bad
experiences, analysis of these bad experiences is essential to see where the
quality shortfall has occurred.  Problems with the early models were due to
having to use whatever components that were available, which were not
necessarily well suited to the stresses of a small wheel bike.

I have another cause of repeated punctures to add to the list. Several times
I have had a (non-Brompton) puncture from a splinter of glass, I repaired
the puncture but realise that the glass was still embedded in the tyre. A
few miles more riding and the glass punctures the inner tube again. So when
you have found the puncture, check the tyre in the same region for fragments
of glass, etc.

I agree with Philip - what causes more stress - a heavy rider on a good road
or a light rider on a bad road our 10 years' trouble-free experience with 2
Bromptons can't surely just be down to our weighing under 150lb?

Subject: RE: Reliability & Punctures

This issue of reliability unsurprisingly has been well gone over several
times on this list.  The extreme variation in people's experience of
Brompton use is the really interesting fact.  My previous input to this
topic started with the physical aspect of the rider - there is no doubt that
a 14 stone (196lb) rider is going to stress and accelerate wear and tear
much more than a relatively puny individual such as myself who cannot muster
more than 135lbs - like the difference of over half a hundredweight of
luggage which few, in the developped world anyway, would strap onto a
conventional diamonnd frame let alone  a portable bike.
The other highly variable element in these discussions is the range of uses
to which the Brompton bicycle is employed.  I have always regarded it as an
essentially urban machine intended for shorter distance domestic and
commuting purposes.  It is a tribute to the design that it has been used
with apparent success for epic heavily laden camping trips in
wilder parts, but that is not because of intrinsic suitability but because
of the folding which makes it transportable by train or bus.
I too have had a sprocket split (the old 3/32 inch type), loose spokes on
the old steel rims, and quite worn out a few Raleigh Record tyres - but I
have used the machine for almost every working day  in the 11 years that I
have owned it and I can't imagine life without it.  I calculated that I have
spent on maintenance 80 per cent of the cost of a new T5 in this period,
including 2 new handbuilt alloy wheels and a new rear fork assembly which
was also rebushed later.
I avoid car driving as much as possible, so my meagre 3500 miles of motoring
last year cost a huge whack in fixed overheads, petrol, depreciation, hidden
overheads of pollution, global warming contribution etc . A lot more than 11
years of bike repairs.
It is really sad that people are put off this wonderful bike by bad
experiences, analysis of these bad experiences is essential to see where the
quality shortfall has occurred.  Problems with the early models were due to
having to use whatever components that were available, which were not
necessarily well suited to the stresses of a small wheel bike.

For that reason I always remove the wheel. With a bit of practise it's done
in about 2 minutes. The tube is much easier to repair with the wheel
removed, and the whole thing is a lot easier to handle.

The trick here is to find the leak with the tire on.

Unless it is obvious from the case I release the caliper, take the 
tube right out & inflate it enough to find the leak.

I can only repair a tube in situ if the escape of air is rapid enough to be
detected by listening carefully or by feeling it on the cheek.   A slow air
leak or a noisy environment and I'v ehad it - the wheel has to come off.

I don't know how we compare in the quantity stakes, but I did spend 5 years
in a garage repairing punctures on all manner of things including builders'
plant among other mechanic's duties. At a really wild guess, I can
guesstimate 3 that failed. Compare this with two tubes where the valve-patch
had come adrift ! OK, this is likely to have happened when the tyre was flat
and the vehicle still being used !

My first puncture in the Brompton rear was ! I found the hole, marked the
tyre and removed 4" either side of the hole of one side of the tyre to get a
little bit of tube out - so I didn't even take the whole side off the rim.

Carefully examine the tyre for holes that look new or are glass filled. Pump
the tyre up and see where it hisses out !

Pressing too hard on the pedals, were you ? Just kidding - it's the worst
I've heard of them.

>
> Since new in April 1999 & 4650 miles the history is:-

Brakes not brilliant, but adequate. In all my cycling, I've never had a
cable break nor have I had to replace one. (That's on _my_ bike)

> 2 - 30-40 punctures.
> 3 - Split rear wheel rim
> 4 - fractured handlebars.
> 5 - now the sprocket.
>

Mine's a month or 2 older. I can't say I've done the mileage, I don't count
them. The bike is treated as a tool, not as a Sunday leisurely rider.
Despite being 13St10 and muscly built, I've had creaks out of several things
but nothing's broken. The only unaccountable failure I've had was the rear
brake cable nipple coming out of the brake lever. No cable breakages nor
brake parts failing despite me getting the levers back to the handlebars on
odd occasions - and this with the brakes adjusted properly.

The only "failure" I'd complain about is the rusting in the seat post tube
which started within 3 months of use.

I don't know what that one was, but my original front is brilliant. It
impresses several of the regular social riders I ride with on a Wednesday
evening and on Monday this week I had an oncoming car go to main beam as I
presume they thought mine was too bright. Shame I don't feel the same about
the rear one.

I've hit both pedals on the ground on more than one occasion. The plastic
one gets scuffed, the folding on went trapezoidal so wouldn't fold until I
straightened it.

>I never remove my wheels to repair punctures.

You must be a key hole surgeon then?  ;-)

Seriously though, 30 - 40 punctures in 1 1/2 years is staggering, a-typical
and totally unacceptable for any bike. If you always repair punctures with
the wheels in situ then I'm certain that's part of the cause of your
misfortune.
Doing it this way means:

It's much harder to check that the tube isn't being trapped between the tyre
bead and rim when reassembling.

It's well nigh impossible to check the entire inside of the tyre for glass
fragments that just penetrate to the inside


The inner tube is likely to be replaced so that it's stretched in one part
of it's circumference and crumpled and/or twisted diametrically opposite
which will cause chafing punctures.

It's just such an apallingly fiddly way of doing it!

My very carefully evolved puncture repair technique involves:

Always removing the tyre completely so you can check the entire inside and
outside of the tyre carcass for sharp bits.

Use loads of talc both on the tube and inside the tyre when initially
fitting a new tube. This really helps by lubricating the tube so it can
settle into the most comfortable and unstretched/untwisted position inside
the tyre.

Of course having all this talc means you must be careful to remove it in the
punctured area before applying glue. Wipe it off with a little moisture and
then roughen up with sandpaper. I use an angle grinder when I'm at home for
speed!

Fit just one side of the tyre to the rim and then inflate the tube so that
it's the same softness as a sausage before feeding it back into the tyre -
about two pump strokes. If it's completely uninflated then it's not going to
untwist and distribute itself evenly and the flatness of its shape means
it's much more likely to be trapped under the tyre bead. If it's too hard
then it'll be difficult to replace the tyre bead without using levers.

NEVER use levers to replace a tyre - it's just so easy to pinch the tube -
evolve steel fingers if necessary, these are also useful for squeezing the
patches on really hard. It helps if you squeeze the tyre beads together at
one point so that they can sit in the deepest part of the well of the rim at
one part of its circumference and then hold the rim on the ground with your
toes at this point and then pull the tyre up diametrically to the other side
of the rim so that you transfer as much 'slack' as you can to this side of
the wheel to make pushing the final few inches of bead over the lip of the
rim with your fingers as easy as possible.

Always remember to push the valve in towards the circumference of the tyre
and then pull it back towards the wheel centre before inflating - this
ensures that this part of the tube at least is not trapped under the bead.
Novices invariably neglect this step and experience a puncture after bump
bumping about a mile down the road on a trapped tube.

Squidge and knead the tyre all round to encourage the tube to fill the outer
circumference away from the tyre beads.

Only now should you reinflate.

If you're an urban cyclist then about 90% of your punctures should be being
caused by broken glass (damn all the pissheads out there). Small glass chips
rarely penetrate in one go but actually can take some weeks to cut their way
right through the tyre casing - though much quicker in the rain as water
acts as a lubricant for high friction rubber. For this reason, I've found
that the most effective puncture prevention strategy is to weekly or so,
under a strong light very carefully inspect the tyres from the outside,
probing every slit and hole and flicking out any flecks of glass with a semi
pointed tool. You can count the relative frequency of clear, brown and green
glass to establish the drinking preferences of your local population. I have
a pair of smooth jawed very fine pointed pliers that I normally use in my
electronics work. These are ideal but at over 30 quid I couldn't recommend
everyone to rush out and buy a pair.

These procedures may sound lengthy but overall they save tens of hours over
a year, I get about 4 to 6 punctures in a year of a very considerable
cycling distance.

Mostly very sound advice.  I would avoid talc, as it is a relative of
asbestos.  Nasty stuff.  If you follow the rest of "Krip's" advice, you
will have very few problems.

If you do patch tubes, a good rule of thumb give up and replace the tube
when there are two patches already on it, assuming you live in an
industrialized country.

I would venture to guess that few people realize that talc, which many of us
have used around the shop and house for a lifetime is a known severe lung
irritant on a par with asbestos, due to its similarly structured tiny,
sharp, needle-like hard particle structure -- much worse than fiberglass
insulation, around which most people wear respirators these days -- and most
probably carcinogenic.

It works so well, as a dry lubricant though, that I am eager to find a good
substitute. What about chalk dust, or some other relatively inert, but
softer material? (Anything that interacts with water, like, say, cornstarch,
would probably not be suitable.)

As someone who spends altogether too much time around chalk dust, I don't
recommend it as a dry lubricant.  Alas, the use of a respirator would
probably impair other activities that I usually engage in while I'm around
chalk dust.

All the puncture repair outfits I have ever had have come with either a
puffer bottle of chalk dust or, more usually, a block of chalk and a piece
of sandpaper that can use to "grate" chalk over the tube.   Works for me.

Thanks for all the puncture replies - the one below (removed as it 
was very long) was particularly useful. MAny of the things stated 
I had already adopted. The 20-30 punctures were early & all due to 
penetration - around here it is firstly slivers of whatever stone is 
used on our roads & secondly glass. My current problem is how to get 
over the tape "rub" punctures (fairly rare - usually one in life of a 
case) as the slime dosn't seem to be recommended. BTW I havn't had a 
any penetration punctures since using tape & waiting to see if the 
filleted tube covers solve it.

In relation to reliability from my list of woes on Monday I forgot 
the broken pedal!

It seems that the overall views of the contributors to the list that 
pedal cycles are an unreliable (& not particuluarly economic) form of 
transport & that is how the world is. As I said before - very 
depressing!

I wouldn't have thought it true that this was the overall view of
contributors to this list that pedal cycles are unreliable. As in so many
other cases, people are less likely to write just to say that for them, the
cycle is reliable. Complaints are always more easily heard.

One thing I think should be borne in mind: I drive as well as cycle, as I'm
sure do other contributors. Cars have increased dramatically in reliability
since I first drove in the late 1960's, and also in comfort and performance,
which is one of the reasons I feel it is so difficult to get motorists to
leave them behind these days even for short journeys. But when something
needs repair, the cost is horrendous and as far as I can see there is very
little these days that the enthusiastic amateur can do to rectify ignition
problems or engine adjustment. These can only be carried out by garages with
sophisticated equipment which usually diagnose the replacement of whole
modules rather than the small parts such as plugs, points, etc from
yesteryear. Basically, if your modern car breaks down, you're stuffed until
it's returned to the dealer - even the roadside organisations are limited
much more these days to empty fuel tank, etc.

Point is, with bikes - as we can see from all the suggestions involving
household powders, glues, basic mechanical tools etc, even fingers - it is
still possible (a) for almost anyone to effect basic repairs (whatever the
different views are on how to repair a puncture) and (b) for almost anyone
to make a (possibly unique) improvisation in carrying those repairs out when
on the road and without a full workshop available. Try repairing the
ignition block on your car when it suddenly packs up. Toxic or not, talc is
of no help...

As for the question of cost, this is a contentious area and it is not my
intention to start a huge debate since it is possibly off the theme of
Brompton-talk. But surely one must consider overall cost (environment) when
looking at the bike as transport and in that respect surely it must rate
with the train at the most economic end of the scale, while the car must be
at the other end.

The only patch glue available to take on the bike here in the US comes in
small tubes with a screw top.  Thirty years ago, or so, I was able to get
glue (I think it came from Germany) that came in tiny red or orange "pill
sized" gel- like containers.  It was a single use product so you didn't have
the "dried out when you need it" problem.

I wonder if this product is still available anywhere (in Europe?).  It was a
great idea!

It's even hard to find a large "shop size" container of glue to use at home.
When I was a kid they used a metal can with a brush in the lid in all the
bike shops (maybe a pint) and in auto garages when there were still car
inner tubes to repair [I wonder what kids use now in pools and on the snow?
Those old car tubes were cheap, durable, and lots of fun!].  I made the
discovery, when I found out that these cans where no where to be found, that
"Elmers Contact Cement" works well, is cheap, and comes in a fairly large
plastic bottle with a brush in the lid.  This is what I use when I do my
"batch repairs" at home.

        Bob

I see no reason to replace a tube only because it has two patches. IMHO the
repair when properly done is as good as the original tube. I replace the
tube when damage occurs on an already patched area, so that overlapping
repairs would result.

I'm very sorry Jeff, that I have to disagree on this one. But I am
certainly _not_ sharing that view. Quite to the contrary: I find my
Brompton+Bus+Train mobility solution far superior to whatever
alternative I can imagine, including cars, both for reliability and for
economical reasons: I go where I want without accidents or traffic jams,
for far less guilders per kilometer.

What I _am_ interested in, is your weight, your "mode of cycling" (rough
or cautious), and the average condition of the roads you use. This would
put all those failures into proper perspective. I haven't had any of the
problems you mentioned, except for having to stop the brake blocks from
eating my rims by replacing them with Koolstops, but you could call me
lightweight (61kg), and I do have a moderate mode of cycling on our
mostly well maintained roads (Netherlands: cyclepath country).

Nico

	This is what I was longwindedly trying to say.  When I said that my
11 years-old T5 has cost 80 percent of a new model to maintain, I forgot
that it still has a secondhand sale value so the overall cost of ownership
on disposal is about 480 UK pounds minus about 200 recouped on selling.  The
net cost is thus less than 300 UK pounds or 25 UK pounds per year of
ownership.

My B has been trouble free since inception, no punctures in 1.5 years and
600 mi.

I DO pay attention to what I drive over, I weigh 160 lbs.

I notice that hitting the pavement hard, through rough riding, punches air
out of the tires by sheer force, but the tires do not leak otherwise.  the
force of this rough riding also makes the seat telescope down proportionate
to the impact, so I know when I'm riding hard.

>From the thread, the other individual with reliability issues is getting 5x
more use by mileage, and seeing 30x more punctures and other ills.

Whilst car have become increasingly reliable and sophisticated, its still
possible to do some routine maintenance and repairs that occur frequently
such as changing the oil, blown bulbs, ignition cable, spark plugs .... but
emissions has made distributor, timing, and gas/air mixture taboo.  For the
B, nearly all parts can be user serviced with proper instruction, and few
parts are custom and trouble free such as the frame & handlebars.

A reliable car to begin with is vital to minimize the frequency of routine
maintenance.  Parts should be relatively generic.  The B is all that.

So, B reliability unlikley the issue, the unfortunate B owner must ride it
hard; BTW how much do you weigh sir?  Recall that F=ma.

    When they figure the cost per mile of operation of an automobile here in
the USA (this is used a lot in figuring tax deductions), they look at ALL
the costs of operation; gas, repairs, tires, insurance, depreciation,
parking, etc.

    If you want to know the cost/mile (km) of operating a bike you have to
do the same thing.  I'm sure it's only a very few cents ($US) per mile, a
VERY small fraction of what car ownership costs.  Has anyone ever figured it
for themselves?

If you bought a new Brompton every year and threw it away when the 12 months
had expired, it would still only be a fraction of the cost of running a car.
A new car in the UK is said to lose twenty five percent of its value the
moment it's driven from the garage where it was purchased.

It would be interesting to compare the cost of a Brompton with more
conventional bikes, but even then there are difficulties. There must be many
of us who combine using our Brompton with some form of public transport
where otherwise a car would have been used because the bike journey would
have been too lengthy or arduous. How does one measure that?

It does seem to me that if someone is using a bike as a principal means of
transport, carrying heavy loads, riding on rough surfaces and not needing to
take advantage of the Brompton's foldability/portability, why not just use a
mountain bike instead with fat tyres? I'm sure I'm not the only person who
has both types of bike and chooses the more appropriate one for a particular
purpose.

I have found this thread quite interesting.  

I would say my impression of 9000 miles commuting on my B was that it had
been very good.  However, if I list everything that I have changed it looks
rather less good (list below).  The good news is that the parts are very
cheap compared to car parts (or even fashionable mountain bike parts) and
that the work is easy to do myself.  The cost would probably be very
significant if everything on my list had involved paying a bike shop to do
the work.

To reinforce the view that the manner of usage is important I would say that
the parts replacement rate has reduced dramatically since I stopped using a
gravel canal path and found a road route to work instead.  I weigh about 185
lbs and 90%+ of my mileage has been with a laden front bag.  I also ride
fairly hard I think.

Replacements @ 9000 miles

5 speed hub  (under warranty - failed in first few 100 miles).
2 rims       (new ones lasting much better with kool stop blocks)
1 front hub
1 dynamo     (disintegrated bearings)
2 rack stays (dynamo mounting point failures - the first took a Nordlicht
with it - I now have an extra reinforcement strip to protect the current
expensive S6 dyno)
1 handlebar
1 front main frame (replaced under warranty - and Brompton did a lot of
other little jobs at the same time I noticed)
1 folding pedal bearing (Brompton exchange service)
3 chains
1 frame clamp bolt (fatigue crack on the clamp)
2 rear sprockets (13 tooth, the current 14 tooth seems to be indestructible)
1 rear light (corroded reflector)
1 rear brake cable outer (corroded internally)
1 bottom bracket (actually not replaced yet but it's ready to be)

I can't remember exactly how many tyres I have used (perhaps 4) or punctures
I have had (<12).

I have never failed to complete a journey under my own steam (all the
critical failures were detected by inspection rather than failing in use). 

regards



Peter

That is quite clear. I was talking about maintenance cost of my (small) car
vs. the Brompton..

Subject: RE: Cost/mile (km) of bike vs. car


If you bought a new Brompton every year and threw it away when the 12 months
had expired, it would still only be a fraction of the cost of running a car.
A new car in the UK is said to lose twenty five percent of its value the
moment it's driven from the garage where it was purchased.

It would be interesting to compare the cost of a Brompton with more
conventional bikes, but even then there are difficulties. There must be many
of us who combine using our Brompton with some form of public transport
where otherwise a car would have been used because the bike journey would
have been too lengthy or arduous. How does one measure that?

It does seem to me that if someone is using a bike as a principal means of
transport, carrying heavy loads, riding on rough surfaces and not needing to
take advantage of the Brompton's foldability/portability, why not just use a
mountain bike instead with fat tyres? I'm sure I'm not the only person who
has both types of bike and chooses the more appropriate one for a particular
purpose.

    When they figure the cost per mile of operation of an automobile here in
the USA (this is used a lot in figuring tax deductions), they look at ALL
the costs of operation; gas, repairs, tires, insurance, depreciation,
parking, etc.

    If you want to know the cost/mile (km) of operating a bike you have to
do the same thing.  I'm sure it's only a very few cents ($US) per mile, a
VERY small fraction of what car ownership costs.  Has anyone ever figured it
for themselves?

In regard to my weight I'm 86kg
I carry a maximum of 7 or 8kg on my front carrier rack (occasionally 
10) - what is the maximum?
I've only done less than 20 miles off road (only on good compressed 
surface in the dry) because the bike feels like it's going to shake 
itself to bits.
Average road surface is well tarmaced probably 5-10mm shattered hard 
roadstone which gives constant vibration - Some worse some better. 
Quite a lot where the surface breaks to give a 10-20mm vibromassage 
surface.
Virtually all surfaces have a covering of sharp grit & broken glass.
E. Southampton which is where I work out from is fairly hilly.
I do find I am "driving" the whole time. My broken sprocket is 
"burred" by the chain on the driving faced of the teeth.
I do journeys of up to 60 miles for pleasure on country roads - most 
with reasonable worn smooth surfaces.
I never drive up curbs but will hop up ledges of up to 25mm - I have 
never had a pinch puncture.

My impression Jeff is your broken glass terrain contributes to your
puncture issue.

nix nix!  I just haven't been posting lately :-)

I have had exactly one flat on my old MTB in 12 years.

I owned the same ratty old MTB for 12 years, did almost no
maintenance, and it took me everywhere I wanted to go.
I don't ride the B as much locally, it's more of a travel 
bike (as in travelling on business and wanting to have a 
bike wherever I go) so it has low miles on it;  I can't
speak to its reliability under daily use.  my daily
commute bike has always been a fat-tyre MTB.

The B imho, and I know a lot of you all will disagree, is a 
specialty bike.  It folds up and travels unobtrusively on 
aeroplanes as luggage, avoiding the swingeing great punitive 
bike fees those thugs otherwise charge us.  That's why it 
commands the price it does...  I only have to take 16 flights 
(8 round trips) saving a $50 bike fee each time, to pay for the 
$800 basic bike.  So I don't really expect it to stand up to 
the kind of pounding, bashing, trailer- hauling, rain, salt 
spray, etc to which my work bike is subjected regularly.  I 
consider it an expensive luxury item like a minox camera or a 
laptop computer -- expensive because of its compactness and 
ingenuity, and to be treated with some care.  I realize this
is rank heresy, so I apologize, it's just my personal take
on the little red folder.

anyway, back to pedal bike reliability.

I have never had a chain jump the rings.  I have occasionally
got stuff jammed into the chain/cone juncture -- tough
vegetation, or on one memorable occasion the strings of 
a hat that fell off my rear rack.  I once had a tyre develop
a hernia (detected the nasty whompling sensation where it
was rubbing against the brake assembly, stopped, released
that brake, and rode home very carefully to replace the
tyre and tube).  And I'm not one of those maintenance freaks
who has the bike in pieces every other Saturday so that I
can admire my reflection in the inside bearing surfaces.
It's a vehicle.  I use it.  When it starts to perform badly
I fix it, investing the minimum in cash and effort.  I
treated my cars, back when I owned cars, the same way --
but "the minimum" was a heckuva lot more.

I have only twice had to walk home wheeling a bike -- once was 
aforementioned flat which I got when riding across an open 
field in tall grass, and picked up a sharp thorn/twig.  the
other was when a car jumped the kerb and pretzeled my bike
(the one before the MTB, so more than 12 years ago) where it
was locked to a street-sign post.

I don't live in a bike-friendly environment, though it's not as 
bad as say NYC or urban London.  Local road surfaces are quite 
bad, RR xings are hellish, and there's a lot of broken glass 
about, thanks to (a) drunken slob vandals and (b) the 
neighbourhood recycling trucks which tend to drop bits of their 
cargo now and then.  The reason I don't get flats, imho, is 
that I keep my tyres as hard as they will stand, 80lbs+.  I 
don't have kevlar liners or any other fancy stuff.  Slime is an 
exploded theory imho. Messy, unpleasant, and of dubious 
efficacy.  

Anyhoo... about cost/benefit:  I had 12 years of transport out 
of a bike that probably cost me all of US$500 over that 12 
years -- $250 for the bike, and maybe as much as $250 in parts 
and one pro tune-up at the 8-year mark.

I would say the pedal cycle is a completely reliable and
incredibly cost-effective form of transportation.

I now have a new bike (and the old one as well, sigh... just 
can't bear to get rid of it).  since it is new and shiny, I 
actually washed it once after getting some mud on the frame :-) 
I was washing it and giving the chain a quick clean, etc. last 
weekend and thinking how many hours my neighbour was spending 
washing his car and tuning it up.  Actually he owns about 5 or
6 cars and 3 motorbikes, so you could say that they dominate
his spare hours completely.  This is how he has fun, so 
chacun a son gout :-) 

I was done with the bike massage in maybe an hour, maybe a bit 
less.  It's not just the money it saves you.  It's the time.  I 
used to work on my own cars, and ohboy do I look back in anger 
on the hours and hours of my life that I spent tinkering with 
those balky critters. 

bikes rule ok

I'll shut up now :-)  sorry, but that depressing diss of the
pedal cycle got a rise out of me.

I see at least two interesting issues here:

Money costs: When figuring money costs, be sure to start with the cost of
gasoline per mile. But then add the cost of the car, the cost of
insurance, the cost of hospitalization and medical bills, etc. This will
make the cost of riding a bicycle look even better compared to the 
automobile.

Speed: It takes about an hour to go 60 miles in a car (say). The same
distance may take (say) 4 hours by bike. However, when comparing the time
it takes for the car and bike, make sure you add the time you must work to
pay for the car, the time you must commute to hold the job you need to pay
for the car, the time spent working to pay for the insurance the car
requires, the time spent in the hospital from car accidents, etc. Adding
these times to the one hour needed to go 60 miles in the car makes going
60 miles by car take a lot longer than by biccycle!!!


So, the bike wins out as costing less than the car and allowing faster
travel!!

OK, suprise.

CAR:
I have (garaged) a Nissan PU bought used @ $11K.   Total expense since '94=
    Capitalization costs -- 7000.  (or $6000, depending on resale)
    garage (equivalent)  --  7500.  (@$125/mth)
    expenses               --  5850  (gas, insurance, register, tickets, 
everything else)
                        ________
                         $20350.  for 1/95 - 12/99
Miles driven in this time were low, 32,200 total.  So, cost per mile are 
about $0.64/.  

BIKES:
I've bought 5 bikes (and one total rebuild) in this time.  Having spent 
~$4600, they are now worth (conservatively) ~$1600-1900 I guess.  So Capital 
costs of ~$3000.

    Total expenses = $5210.  (repairs, panniers, lights, locks, trailers, ...)
    Capital costs    =   3000.  (high cost value; if resale is higher, this 
$$$ drops)
    garage (equiv)   =   4140.   (at $60./mth)
                              ________
                     $12350.    

So bike costs have run about $12,350. for the 5.7 yr period.  Does not 
include some transit costs, but those are small (holidays mostly); most 
commuting is entirely by bike.
    
Hard to estimate mileage.  Have been averaging 400-600/ mth since I stopped 
driving.  But for the entire time (5.7 yrs) the costs per mile will probably 
be high.  Jsut because my miles were probably low during the first few yrs.  
Say 15-20,000 for the 5.7 yrs. (Didn't start commuting til '98).  

Still, it looks to be at least  $0.64/mi. for the truck.  And about the same 
for all the bikes, up to this point.

[A significant figure in both calc's was the garage.  I figures half the cost 
of a garage for the bikes, though they really take up MORE space.  But I 
could probably put them in the back yard and use the side door.  Can't do 
that with a truck; and if left on the street, the parking tickets would 
probably be  as high or higher than the garage costs.]

Sadly this is not what I expected when I started pulling the figures 
together.  On the plus side, the bikes should be cheaper to run from here on 
out.  No gas, insurnce, and they are almost capitalized out, with cheaper 
"garage" costs.  The truck still has $4000 resale (vs $1600 for the bikes), 
with higher garage and insurance costs; so that will continue to be more 
expensive than operating a bike.  But  the idea of "pennies per mile' doesn't 
seem to bear out, from my expenses.  (I do drop dollars on the bikes like 
that; and am notoriously cheap on the truck.  Still, ...)

Thats pretty accurate.  Comments?

Don't forget - car running costs (especially gas) are ridiculously low in
the US compared to almost everywhere in the developed world (and certainly
Europe). Second - without wishing to hammer the environmentalist message too
far - the costs which have been listed are the immediate, direct, personal
costs to the owner. What about the cost to the environment caused by the car
compared to the bikes - manufacture, consumption, repair, disposal?

Ah yes, Cost vs expense, as like Value vs price?  But I agree with your 
point.   Mine were truly only the expenses.  

Unless there is an extreme "cost" from B.O.  ;-)

    1.  I think a lot of us spend $ on our bikes the same way we'd buy
presents for a girl (boy) friend.  Fiddling with gear/sprockets, trying new
tires, a new horn, etc.  Certainly some people do this with their cars.
Eliminating these surplus expenditures would bring down your costs.

    2. You compared 5 bikes to 1 car.  Certainly many could have done their
riding on a single bike (like in the 3rd world where a bike is a primary
means of transportation).  Could 4 of the bikes be looked upon as "surplus
expenditures" ?

    3.  Hanging (like bats) the bikes in the garage means they really don't
take any space/expense  at all (unless your garage didn't come with your
apt/house), unless you had another use for the rafter space.

Yes.  Good point.  But that brings up the "reliability" issue;  I've gone for 
'more' bikes, jsut so I don't have to mess with a flat tire, or a rubbing 
sound, or whatever that v day -- if I don't car to, and can still get where 
I'm going in the morning.  (Sometimes I don't feel comfortable with even 
"just two".)

OK.  Just for the sake of argument -- say I had a Super-Brompton(TM).  Go 
anywhere -- take anywhere.  I could ditch the garage -- 1/3 of my cost right 
there.  Since its a Super-Brompton(TM), Cap costs remain the same (probably 
alot less, as I imagine they have a high resale price/value).  That is my 
second 'third -- cut in half.  Then the last third -- lights. locks, 
raingear, trailer ...  Well I have had to buy 5 sets of computers, lights, 
locks ....  So if we cut that by 1/3, then the numbers would look like this:

    SuperB:
        Expenses -- $3400
        Cap Cost  --   1500
        garage      --        0
                    ________
                     $4900 for 15-20,000 miles, 

or $0.25/ -- 0.33/ per mile, as a guess.  That is still being pretty 
free-spending
so it could (have) gone to maybe $0.15 or 0.20/ mile; and even less if I 
wanted to skimp on having a great machine.   And of course the ratios drop 
the more you ride!

(This intrigues me.  Think I'll keep an eye on it.)

All these expenses are still less than a car; even a beater car I believe.  
And the rewards are ...

Hang about. I'm talking about the perfumed talc that some people liberally
coat quite delicate parts of their anatomy with on a regular basis. Are
those people who use it in this way dropping like flies or is this so much
hearsay?. No trace of a health warning on any of the ones I've seen in the
chemist. From its slipperiness I would have guessed the crystals are loosely
bonded ring shaped layers like graphite but that's just a guess. I'm amazed
to hear all this. Chalk would seem a poor substitute as gymnasts, climbers
etc use it to improve the grip of their hands.

It is amazing that talc is still available for personal use, but you might have noticed that talc is no longer used for baby powder at least in the US.  That product has changed to corn starch.

As far as all this talk about reliability, I find the Brompton probably more reliable for my uses than conventional bikes largely because the chain never falls off like every derailleur bike I have ever ridden does.  But generally I am not happy with the reliability of conventional bikes.  This is a market situation: Most of the market does not treat biking as serious transport but as leisure activity and is cost sensitive.  I hope this changes before the oil runs out, but I am not holding my breath, as we say.

I want a bike with no chain at all that can shift while stopped.  But still light and efficient, recumbent front wheel drive, blah blah blah...

	Second bike could be made rather less in cost.  And 3d bike
	*way*  cheaper.  Flat tire quick-remedy can be partly-accomplished
	by merely rotating wheels; by borrowing a wheel from a back-up
	bike.

	However to do this one must be looking for standardization
	and quick-modified adjustments.

	No recumbent mentioned.

	A reason for one of those  _additional_  bikes is rain.

	A beater car can foster dependance.  Soon one is tied
	to something suggesting careless-maintainance and high 
	emissions; one is tied to & dependant on a non-together thing.

(If anyone can track down this statistic, I'd sure 
appreciate a reference.) Some years ago I read "somewhere 
online" that the average cyclist can make about 12 mph 
over average urban/suburban terrain -- excluding, say, the 
hillier bits of SF CA, the Peak in Hong Kong, etc.  The 
average car driver in light traffic can make 20 mph over 
the same turf.  Car wins! 

Or does it? If you factor in all the time the car driver 
spends, as James said, working to pay for insurance, to 
pay for the car, to pay for registration, repairs, upkeep, 
gasoline etc -- and the time that some car drivers spend 
washing, waxing, waiting at repair shops, standing in line 
at the DMV, driving around looking for a parking space, 
hiking across huge parking lots, whatever -- then the car 
driver makes about the same 12-13mph (that is, real hours 
of life-time invested to cover those same miles) over the 
same terrain.  Can anyone verify this, or track down the 
source of this stat? 

I'm intrigued by this alternative measure of efficiency.  
Money is one thing, but we also have a universal currency, 
and that is time.  We live only so many heartbeats, and 
the hours of our life that we invest in this-and-that are 
a truer indicator of real cost (imho) than the dollars.  

Just supposing for a moment that the 12 mph stat is true:

If you now factor in gridlocked urban traffic where the
car driver is trapped in stop-n-go for 2 hours to cover
20 miles, the cyclist is actually getting there sooner than
the car driver, and the car driver is down to 6mph if you
count all the labour time working to pay for the car...

Which leads me to another interesting consideration of 
distance travelled vs hours worked to accomplish the 
travel. 

Suppose I can buy a plane ticket to Hawai'i for anywhere 
from $600 to $1200 US (round trip) depending on season, 
discounts, whether I'm willing to stay up all night, etc.  -- 
and let's say that this is a 5000 mi round trip... and 
that I would have to work say 20 hrs to 40 hrs (at $30/hr, 
a middle-class wage) to pay for that ticket... plus 12 hrs 
in the air (round trip) and an additional 3 hrs each end 
per travel day getting to and from airports, so 24 hrs for 
the travelling itself...  then I've invested say 44 to 64 
hrs of my life to travel 5000 miles.  

113 mph, or 78 mph, depending on the dollar cost of the 
ticket. 

Whereas the car driver, using an allegedly "ordinary and 
everyday" form of transport, considered less special and 
luxurious than air travel, is only getting from 6 to 13 
mph.  

Of course the car driver is travelling in sinful, solitary 
luxury (at least the average US car driver is!), with a 
personal stereo, snacks, a/c, heater, and the illusion of 
complete freedom of movement.  On the other hand, I can 
read a book all the way to HI :-) and though the 
discomfort of coach- class air travel is a byword, if I 
get a window seat at least part of my trip is 
entertaining... the seat is more comfortable in the 
average car... the view is better from the plane :-) Call 
it incalculable, whether 6 hrs in a car is "heavier" or 
"lighter" than 6 hrs in a plane.  

If I paid the same cost/mile (in real hours of my life) to 
get to HI and back as the car driver pays per mile to 
cross town (let's take the charitable 12mph figure, not 
the gridlock 6mph), then I'd invest 417 hrs or (at $30/hr) 
a whopping $12K US, to get there.  

I think this is a voodoo numbers game I'm playing here -- 
not as bad voodoo as GNP or GDP, but still more playful 
than serious. but it says something to me about apparent 
speed (the wallclock time between leaving A and arriving 
at B) vs invested life-time per mile...  

Of course, one Canadian doctor says that regular use of
a bike for transport can add up to 20 years to your
life expectancy, so maybe our real mph for bike travel
needs to be weighted for adding hours onto your life
span!

And finally someone gets around to the most important point.  Thanks
De.  Not to mention the improved quality of life.  Since I started
biking a few thousand miles per year and skiing a few hundred I rarely
if ever get sick anymore.  And what pleasure in the trip.

With all of this cost analysis going on, just a couple of
thoughts to throw into the hopper.

(1) I spend about 30 minutes on the daily 8 mile round-trip
    commute. If I were to take the car, it would be about half
    that, say 15 minutes.

    So, at the cost of 15 minutes I get the exercise that a
    driver would have to spend say 45 minutes at the health
    club--perhaps on a stationary bike!--to get (under the
    assumption that real biking is better exercise than stationary
    biking by a 1.5 factor).

    ...and, of course, there is another 15 to 30 minutes expended
    by the driver to get to and from the health club.

    ...and I have to admit that I typically lose a few minutes
    on each end cleaning up after the ride.

(2) After seeing the position taken that a motorist needs to add
    to his trip time the time needed to work to pay for higher capital
    and maintenence costs, I wonder if there is actually anyone on
    the list who is working fewer hours because of savings attributable
    to the decision to cycle.

One of the tipper reasons I decided to start bike-commuting was jsut this.  
If I drove, then I had to 'make room' for exercise, which didn't always 
happen.  Whereas, if i *rode*, then I had my exercise already, at minimal 
expense of time.  The savings in gas was jsut the starter-benefit.
P.

Ps:  Do I *really* want an extra twenty years @ 75-95?  Could I trade that in 
for three years at 25 again?        :)

I'll second that, and more efficient as well.

6 October 1999 (Date exercising and cycling started) 222lbs
8 September 2000 (still cycling) 156lbs and feeling great!!!!
Less heartbeats per hour though so maybe that truly is the real measure and
makes up the added 20 years.

And finally someone gets around to the most important point.  Thanks
De.  Not to mention the improved quality of life.  Since I started
biking a few thousand miles per year and skiing a few hundred I rarely
if ever get sick anymore.  And what pleasure in the trip.

> Date exercising

Now THAT sounds like fun. :-)

I've lost about 10 pounds in six months even though I cycle only about 
50 miles per week (five miles each way to work). I'm now down to about 
240lbs, which as I'm pretty heavily built isn't bad. 

Even so, no wonder I break a few things on this poor Brommy on the 
potholes and kerbs of Leeds!  My Zap adds a fair few extra pounds, and 
I always have a heavy notebook bag on my back. I dread to think what 
the total weight is. Must buy some new brake pads!

PHolden960@aol.com,

> Ps:  Do I *really* want an extra twenty years @ 75-95?

The answer is yes. 
Isn't there some Somerset Maugham story about the man who intended to live
the good life until sixty? When he reached sixty, he then chickened out on
killing himself.
As to trading in those years for a couple of years in your mid-twenties, I
would say that most people on Bromptons that I see are of the commuter,
middle-aged variety.
Go back to 25 and you will probably have neither time nor inclination for
this list.

Unlike most members of the list, I don't use my folder to commute or as a
substitute for a car.  For me it is a fun exercise machine.  I congratulate
Mick on his great progress on getting back into shape.  And I think SHAPE is
the key word.  As muscle is heavier than fat, a lot of cycling frequently
does NOT result in that much immediate weight loss.  However, it can result
in very dramatic changes in the way you look [at yourself in the mirror].

After all, who cares what they weigh as long as they look and feel good.  If
we had interplanetary travel, our weight would change all the time!  So if
you've started a cycling regimen to promote physical fitness ( to "lose
weight" as most people say) don't despair if you don't see such dramatic
weight changes as Mick did.  Throw away your scale, but DO keep a watch on
which hole you use to buckle your belt!

I do have some indoor exercise equipment.  When using it I almost always
find myself looking at the clock to see how long it will be before I can
stop.  I always stop when my "time" is up.  I never say to myself "Hey, this
is fun; I think I'll go another hour or two."  On my bike, that happens all
the time.

        Bob

I haven't used them but I was in my brilliant local bike shop yesterday and
another Brompton owner was there with a recently fitted Schwalbe with a
handsome bulge which looked ready to blow out the tyre at any time.

I'm still a dinosaur with Records - boring really - grip not too bad,
puncture resistance pretty good, maybe they have been rather too maligned?

> Drop the Zap to see even more dramatic changes!

I'm sure, but I use my bike for commuting and I'm not always in the 
mood.  There are a couple of place on my trip to work where I hit 
30mph, and one where I hit 35mph. Imagine what those bits are like the 
other way when it's raining, the wind's against me, I've had a long day 
at work, too much lunch, and I've got a cold! 

I've done the trip several times without the Zap and the same amount of 
effort gives me only 7/8mph in places where the Zap assist would let me 
do 10/12mph. The extra speed helps cool me down and generally makes the 
trip more pleasant. The last thing I want is to leave the house and 
pick up my car keys rather than my helmet!

Indirectly, yes.  I could not have bought my flat 9 years ago (in pricey
SW London) & run a car at same time.  I later went part-time & certainly
couldn't keep up house & car payments from the reduced income (was
supposed to make some more money in the freed-up time, but hasn't yet
quite worked that way).

I did chose this place partly as it overlooks 24 hour buses & is a mile
from 2  railway stations & tube (subway).  It was probably slightly
cheaper for having no allocated car space.  Having the Brompton means it
can come up the twisting stair to the flat: safer (& less nuisance
to neighbours) than leaving it in the communal hall.

Mad London housing market means I  couldn't afford to do it now, car or no
car - but that's another tale...

You are confusing Ivan Illich's findings that we spend IIRC a third of our 
working effort earning to pay for getting to work in current 'developed 
society because of its unsustainable placing of work, home, and supply points 
where unnecessary travel is required to get between them - it applies mainly 
to cars, but equally to those who use saya folding bike in combination with 
another wasteful commute of tens or even hundreds of miles by train, bus or 
plane.

The average speed issue is well cover by the London (UK) Travel Survey which 
has consistently returned the bicycle as fastest over a nominal 1.8 mile 
journey, for the following reasons

1) 90% of the time taken is spent making progress 'on vehicle' the remaining 
10% being going to collect the bike and parking it - folding bikes will 
return even better results.

2) the average speed of urban traffic is falling as congestion increases, 
whilst the bike remains comparatively immune from this.

3) you do not have to wait for the bike to arrive and buy tickets - the 
actual journey time for a bus trip in the survey almost matches that for the 
bike but you add nearly 70% to that time in walking to the bus stop, waiting, 
and buying the ticket.

Reminds me of the joke about the woman who swapped her husband of some 50 
years of age for two of five and twenty, and the old Viennese custom of 
having two husbands - one to provide the position and one to perform the 
duties.

Those of a PC persuasion might like to reconfigure these observations to an

We both followed similar tenets, and own flats all paid off by the saving of 
not running a car.  A friend reckons on paying off their mortgage 8 years 
early for similar reasons.  In inner London a car space is worth/costs about 
15,000/dwelling -we've been offered 2000/year to rent out ours (no deal - 
its a nice lawn now)

We watch with interest the many who are buying upmarket flats locally, and 
absolutely having to 'own' a classy sports soft top, especially as they are 
often parked all day for fear of losing the parking space/the owner is at 
work - usually commuting by train or bus.  

Josephine observes that when deciding to go out with a new partner the better 
bet is one with no car, or a grotty old one that you can be sure they 
actually have paid for, rather than some flashy machine which is 90% owned by 
the bank.

For the UK a financial assessment in 1989 reckoning up whole life values over 
20 years found that owning and running an average car would come out some 
75,000 more expensive than owning & running an average house.

Properly adjusted S-A hub just buzzes softly with a tick from the ratchet
if freewheeling.  So quiet a bell is needed on shared paths.  A little
play is needed - mine has about (guestimate by eye) 1 mm movement at rim.
6 months old Sprinter 5.  It is fiddlier than my previous ancient 2-lever
SA-5 to keep adjusted - I usually end up getting a dealer to do this.

Extra noise usually warns of trouble.  Issue for dealer/importer/factory?

Yes nave=hub I guess. Nave is the Meccano word. Normally it should just buzz
but the problem is (not only mine, I've read) that it makes nowadays the
noise of a numer of cans attached to the tail of a cat (when freewheeling).
As I wrote before: I took the whole thing apart, greased, oiled and adjusted
but the problem is still there. Construction problem I think and insoluble.

I don't think so. Mine has *no play* 28 months (probably c. 4000m)
after being serviced (free) by the kind S-A men at Folder Forum 98.
This involved fairly extensive dismantling, cleaning & re-greasing.
It had probably done only about 1000m then but I had just skidded
sideways and dented the wheel with a hard knock on a roadside post
on a bend at the bottom of a steep hill descended when too pissed, 
and was rebuilding the wheel, leg luckily not broken on the post.

Interestingly I discovered the left-hand outer nut loose on checking
for play just now - I probably forgot to tighten it c 1000 miles ago.

Usually, ball bearings should be assembled to be fairly tightly
pre-loaded so that many of the balls will share any further loading.
My S-A *flexes* under manual force but much less than 1mm at the rim.
This is mainly elastic compression of balls & race where they contact.

That's sad. I find it helps to use a mirror - I even carry a small
inspection mirror with a telescopic handle with my tools in on of the
front pannier pockets - from that excellent tool shop near the north
end of Tottenham court road - cheap dental mirrors are also ideal.

I now adjust it so *most* of the red ring on the indicator chain
lies outside the plane of the end of the axle, in second gear unfolded.

David :)

If you have suspect areas, spit on them and see if bubbles form !

Totally agree.

I've had one hole in a tube before and patched it with more than one
overlapping patches. I think a significant thing is to remove internal
corners from the holes to stop splits travelling further - under the
patches. I don't think this is necessary when a correct-sized patch can be
used.

Reminds me of the story of the guy who missed the bus.  He was reading the
newspaper when the bus passed him by at his stop.  He chased after it, only
to miss it at the next stop, and the next, and next.  Finally, to his
surprise, he found that he had run all the way to the stop he usually got
off the bus near his job.

He told this story to his wife -- and bragged about all the money he saved
by missing the bus.  The wife replied: "Why didn't you miss a taxi, you
could have even saved more!!!"

I find car journeys are not only cheaper, can be quicker and go from door to
door without silly restrictions on "luggage".

While we're on "I want"...

I want a bike that weighs 20 lbs, can be converted from 
upright to recumbent in less than 5 minutes with only my 
pocket multitool, folds, has bigger wheels than the B, has a 
Schlumpf type front gear and a 6-spd SA-style rear hub, 
front suspension...  and can carry a serious front
pannier, luggage rack, or both.  And a folding trailer
weighing 15 lbs and able to carry 100.

... plus an ancillary electric drive that clips on and 
removes in less than 1 minute, gives me at least 4 gears' 
worth of advantage, and weighs 10 lbs or less including (non-
toxic) battery, for a range of 10 mi w/o pedalling (which is 
not how I would use it, but gives some idea of the 
amp/hours).

and while I'm at it, how about world peace and an end
to spam?

EEK ! I hadn't realised these rim failures were due to brake wear !

Mine failed within 3 months. The fixed magnets started going round with the
rest - well that's what it sounded like ! The temporary replacement was too
stiff for wet weather.

And, according to Brompton's instructions how often are you supposed to

I find them very effective and don't clamp them tightly as they don't need
it.

Purely lack of maintenance !

Tighten the clamping bolt's nut a little then !

I ride up kerbs carefully and don't notice the seat post sinking despite
getting it oiled last year !

Do you have any hard figures on that?  ("That" is what "they" would like you 
to believe, so ... its important to independently verify as really being 
cheaper).

And what about the car <itself> as luggage, to which 'many' restrictions 
'apply'?    Those (free) parking  lots that let you go from "Door-to-Door" 
probably ought to be calc'd too. (Do include your lot fees, and parking 
tickers in with the expenses!)

One of the advantages of the B is it fits under the coat rack -- next to the 
door.

Even purely economical, that's not a fair measurement to compare bikes
and cars.  Miles driven is more than the distance covered.  For the kind
of travels (or legs thereof) where both bikes and cars are viable, you
will likely drive a longer route then you would ride (catching the main
road, avoiding bottlenecks)

Secondly, the actual displacement themselves are less likely to be
necessary or even desirable.  When you ride your bike past somewhere you
want to be, you'd rather think twice then return some other time.  When
you're driving, the drivers behind you won't let you think once.  A car
increases your long range mobility, so you're expected to behave by it. 
There are more events you don't really care about where you find
yourself obliged to show up.  So some miles are wasted.

And another point, isn't the "keep" value (as opposed to "resale" value)
of bicycles bigger than for cars?  I mean that when you have a 10 year
old car, the chassis is starting to rust and most parts are wearing
out.  There's not much you can do than sell or wait for the next
expensive part to break.  There may not even be a replacement for it. 
What's left is trash.  Whereas on your 10 year old Brompton, your rear
wheel and gearbox are just three years old, the handlebars were replaced
last year etc...  The frame is just scratched, not worn (unless it is
Aluminium).  Even if you ditch the bike, you still have a bunch of new
and old components (like a perfectly shaped saddle) that you can reuse
on any new bike you purchase.

I think, in that many parts are interchangeable (Detroit destroyed that a 
long time ago), this is true.

Heard somewhere that the average life of a bike (MTB?) is seven years.  I 
have a 7 yr old MTB, which I want to ditch but, like a Timex, it keeps on 
ticking.  They do start to run up the costs, though (new derailer, seatpost, 
drivetrain, brakes, shifters, water bottle brackets, computers -- all that 
good stuff; so its almost all new at some point).

But the bike industry is taking its cues from "Detroit" -- brakes, headsets, 
chains, many components are morphing (supposedly for improvements, but try to 
get a 7-speed cassette, roller cam brakes ...) in an effort to *sell/buy*.

Its nice to know that some things, like B, like S-A, like Brooks, retain 
their integrity.

contrary to naive laissez-faire capitalist manifestos, doing it 
wrong is almost always more profitable than doing it right.  
bamboozling the customer into re-purchasing everything they own 
every few years is far more profitable than building quality 
goods that last. 

"economists must learn to subtract" as the saying goes...

uh oh, it must have been the Ivan Illich reference, I'm
starting to rant again... stop, stop...  riding bikes is
more fun than ranting...

I suspect that most Brompton owners have a pair to hand, even if they 
use other tyres some of the time.

I'm not sure that anyone has maligned them. Most would agree that the 
price to performance ratio is good. However, many people on this list 
seem to want to get the ultimate out of their Brompton(s). A new set 
of tyres is relatively cheap as upgrades go and the performance 
benefit (compared to say a set of titanium bolts or a carbon fibre 
seatpost) good.

hmmm... as one curmudgeon to another... I'd be careful with that 
Yuppie label...  people can work like dogs and still never earn
enough to be yuplets.  and some yups are retiring at 35 on their
stock options and never working again.

yeah, some people who own expensive bikes like a B are the same people
who own twin Acuras (his-n-hers), enough stereo equipment to host a
major multimedia event, sporting clothes that cost even more than
the bike, etc. ... and all of it replaced every few years with the
newest and spiffiest.  I'm sure some such people have B's, though 
I would privately bet they are more likely to buy a Bike Friday -- 
'cos it is even more costly, and trendier :-)

whether this list is "dominated" by stereotypical yuppies I kinda doubt,
because of the quality of a lot of the postings... I know a number of yuppies
personally, of various flavours, and their discourse is not very similar
to what I read here :-)  in fact all they talk about is their bloody
portfolios, very boring.

> I think it is silly to discuss the economics of bicycling.  

respectfully disagree!  I would love to see people use bikes for their 
health, or for everyone else's health, or on moral grounds...  but a 
lot of people won't, unless there's a financial incentive as well -- 
which fortunately there is!

Avoid the aggravation of traffic eh?  Gee, I'd like to do that, but
since I'm still sharing the road with those same selfish individuals
(and at a significant strategic disadvantage) I feel there is still
some degree of aggravation involved... but I know what you mean :-)

Hmmm... what an interesting project, "the reasons why I bicycle."  I'd
like to set up a web page poll, actually, it would be fascinating to
see how very different all of our reasoning is.

I'd say my own reasons in order are:

0.  I just slowly started using the bike more and more over time
    because it was *more convenient*...  so "laziness"...

1.  increasing disaffection from the US auto-mania, strong desire to 
    make my daily life comform to my beliefs (i.e. walk my talk, or rather 
    *bike* my talk)...  so "consistency" or "ethics" ...  or even

For my part, we don't plan to replace the second
automobile that recently slipped beyond the "more
trouble to keep it than kiss it goodbye" threshold.

I can get anywhere, pretty much, in Albuquerque by
bicycle--and prefer to. There will be some inconveniences,
of course, but I'm hoping at this point that the second car
will prove unnecessary. It wasn't being used much.

Last Sunday evening my wife drove to cover her
nursing shift at the hospital. That left
three daughters, ages 6 to 9, and I with a social
event to attend, and no car. My wife volunteered to
drive us and our bikes on her way to work up the hill,
about 3-4 miles, leaving us the easier mostly
downhill part to ride home.

We decided, however, to try biking it all--a stretch
exercise for the girls--and we made it! The six year
old was in the trailer, the eight year old pedaled
but had a tow assist on a rope and the eight year old
did it all under her own power, an effort that we
took pains to praise and congratulate.

The return trip was, of course, easy but we did catch
a bit of rain.

I cycle because they're there--a road, two wheels,
two legs, made for each other.

Dear Farrell,

    I used a double trail a bike for myself and two kids for a number of
years (the kids have just graduated to individual bikes).  See:
http://www.westportcomputers.on.ca/bike/ulti2.html  (The site shows
liquidation because these were made in Canada; a new company still makes
them).  I don't know how they would work with a folder; might be a bit much.
I used a mt bike as the tow.  This is really nice because it is quite light
and has gears; the kids really enjoyed it.  The nicest thing is that we were
able to take 20-30 mile tours when my youngest was still on training wheels
on her own bike.  This is a good way to "take the family" without the car.

    You certainly get noticed on one of these.  I never used the "flag" that
the manufacturer supplied to enhance being seen.

        Bob

Bob,

That's a beaut to be sure. We tried a single-speed, single
child "trail a bike" style unit once, but the lack of
gearing made for a real mismatch between the adult
and the child at road speed. At the time, I could imagine
something cool as illustrated in your reference URL,
but I never would have guessed that they existed.

I don't know, though. We may be getting old enough
that we couldn't use it long enough to justify the
investment. How old were your children when it became
no longer practical?

As for the lead bike, I doubt I would use a B, either.
I have a folding MTB that would work well there. Or,
maybe a tandem, then there would be seats for all
three...but heading into cost territory
that might make the second car look attractive again
;-).

Farrell

Dear Farrell,

    The kids started on this contraption about 3 years ago.  They are now 9
and 11.  They probably could have used it another year, but it would have
been a tight fit (they are on the small size).  They really want to feel
"independent" so I didn't force them to use the trail-a-bike thing any more;
I wouldn't want to "force" them to ride, in any event.  We all so enjoy our
rides.  My little girl surprised me by being able to go 10 miles on her 6th
or 7th ride after first learning to ride her own bike this summer!

    On most of these kid "carriers" you can frequently get back much of what
they cost when you sell them, so the real expense is the initial outlay.
The tandem trail-a-bike should be ~$500 if I had to guess; but I have no
idea as I got mine during the "liquidation" for $330.  It'd recommend it!
It was terriffic fun.  It allowed us all to go "together" on these very long
rides.  When you figure only what the final cost (initial minus resale)
would be, it's a lot less than a trip to Disneyland and a WHOLE LOT more
fun.

    I did use this with a tandem once.  Wow, that WAS strange.  Four of us
on one bike.  I felt like a tour bus driver.  It was quite unwieldy but
manageable.  But I didn't do it again.

    I never did hook it up to my Birdy.  As only the lead bike has brakes,
and there is a lot of mass going on one of these, I didn't want to take any
chances with the 3 of us (and we have a lot of big hills here near San
Francisco).

        Cheers,

            Bob

Yeah, - you don't have to go out there and suffer, go out there and play
with them - great fun ! Do you not get great pleasure from whizzing past
stationary queues of cars like I do ?

 Gee, I'd like to do that, but

I had one the other day. Pulled out in front of me as we both approached a T
junction which is why he didn't accelerate away. We were both turning the
same way so I started to overtake him on the correct side. AS I was
alongside him, the road ahead was clear and I got in front of him before he
really got set off again. I held my position - which then held him up. He
blew his horn at me, I blew mine back at him.

I resisted the temptation to shout at him "who did you bribe to get that
licence ?" !

Excersize, Economy, easy to "park" and appropriate for journey length. Odd
social rides too.

Surely a strp-down and re-assembly of the hub would reveal the problem ?

Shock horror !

Since the adjustment needs to be adjusted each time the wheel's removed, it
should be worth getting to know how to diy. I was glad when I got the
setting spec for mine as the dealer I got it off can't set them up properly
!

Good idea - I've gone the contortionist route with back wheel hanging in the
air ! However, with the extra cable-pull assembly, it is harder to see the
indicator mark and judge its position.

Fighting cars on a bike ain't right. It's too easy to get squashed. But
here's an idea I've just read about. A pressure water pistol loaded with car
brake fluid - a great way to strip paint without melting the plastic pistol.
A cyclist in Lille, France has been "Shooting" cars that cut him up. If it
catches on, will there be a folding version?

Viva la revolution!!! (or something like that).

They have been oft maligned.  Cheap for a start, and only really puncture
when tread about half gone but this takes me a year of daily use.  Hard to
get on though.

In a recent Fiat advertisement in Italy (which I've never seen) a cyclist
smiles smugly at a car driver while waiting at traffic lights. Equally
smugly, he props himself against the car.
At the third set of lights, the advert shows the car accelerating, leaving
the propped cyclist to fall to the ground.
Apparently the WWF and others have complained but judging from the reaction
I heard from friends, most people have found the advert highly entertaining.
The point is, as far as the car goes, there is no revenge. Pedestrian and
cyclist are always the losers.

Tim

ps: For all its obsession with the motor car, for years Italy had the
highest petrol prices in Europe - tourists were given discount coupons - and
even today Italian trains are amazingly cheap. And road deaths are lower
than in France.

The usual advice for SA hub is to have some just discernable play feelable
at the rim.  If you don't have some play the bearing can run tight.  A
little play also allows for some tolerance to the axle being slightly out of
true, i.e. a shade bent.  If the axle is bent signigicantly no amount of
adjustment will get the left hand cone adjusted correctly - it will always
be too tight or too loose.

Ive got a mk3 since June had 5 puctures perhaps 7-800 miles 3 in S rear
(thorn, glass and sliver of sharp stone) and two in front Primo thorn/ sharp
sliver stone (latter from 200 miles when I didn't have a S) I have similar
record with PRimo and S but having said that i have been on pathsd that I
wouldn't dare to with Primos
Thats is pretty close to 30 over 18 months

I am only 75kgs sometimes have trailer nearly always front bag with
occasionally up to 14kg shopping. Ride carefully but often hard riding ie
pedalling to catch trains with seconds to spare. Some riding on nasty cycle
paths

Its curious how its so variable;

Hello,

I've just bought my (used) T5 brompton yesterday. Today I discovered that
the dynamo is broken. I thought it might be an good idea to replace it with
an battery pack with rechargeable batteries. Does anyone know about one that
can be mounted to the rear carrier instaed of the original dynamo, without
disturbing the folding process.Thanks for any information !

Best regards
Walter Breum

Ah, yes. The old urban university legend about the engineer at General 
Motors who figured out how to build a car that would last forever and 
would cost peanuts, and got murdered along with all his family by the 
CEO's personal police.  If only my Brompton will last a quarter as long 
as my old Toyota Corolla that has seen 3 kids learn to drive on it and 
still hums at age 17 and 180,000 mi...

It would be an interesting revenge if the driver spun out of control and 
killed an innocent bystander. Otherwise, drivers can sue gun holders for 
damages in civil court and file criminal chargers for damaging private 
property; the gun and its damage are evident.  The cyclists would have to 
prove the cut-off was worthy of vigilante action.

As a cyclist and driver myself, I can understand both sides, and believe 
both are at fault.  Cyclists tend to ignore road rules in Philadelphia 
until recently, when stronger bicycle representation made defined bike 
lanes emphasizing a share the road policy on the caveat that cyclist obey 
the rules of the road.  Bike lanes defined the cycle space, making it 
easier for cars to define the shared areas.

We now have fewer cyclists weaving in and out of traffic rather than 
staying in the bike lane, cutting red lights, going down the wrong 
direction on one way streets etc., It has substantially improved the 
cooperation between cars and bikes in Philly, since cops are not shy citing 
errant cyclists.

I've found the dynamo on the Brompton is excellent. Why not just get a new
dynamo bottle?

Subject: battery pack

Hello,

I've just bought my (used) T5 brompton yesterday. Today I discovered that
the dynamo is broken. I thought it might be an good idea to replace it with
an battery pack with rechargeable batteries. Does anyone know about one that
can be mounted to the rear carrier instaed of the original dynamo, without
disturbing the folding process.Thanks for any information !

Best regards
Walter Breum

Brake fluid doesn't make cars drivers spin out of control - a splodge of
Philadelphia cheese shot in the right angle might! Give it a go!

they mounted it?

I would strongly recommend the DIY route - adjusting the 5 speed is 
one thing I don't get problems with - probably something to do with 
age! Except for the rich kids everyone had hub gears when I was 
"young" so adjustment was part of the cycling life.

The recommended method in the manual works. The mirror as mentioned in
previous correspondence is useful/essential. 

1 - Set up as per manual.
2 - Test by hand pressure on pedals.
3 - The test "live". (I live on a slope which is useful for this.)
4 - At the slightest complaint from the system STOP & adjust.
5 - Adjust in top gear to loosen the cable. Don't forget to jiggle 
the pedals to ensure the gears change up.
6 - Any adjustment invariably involves tightening the cable (hinted 
at in the manual) - but only a very small amount at the time. 
7 - repeat from 3.
8 - Tighten lock nut finger tight while holding the adjuster firmly 
so as not to unadjust. (I don't normally use the lock nut until this 
point.)

Normally takes 2-5 minutes - longer if I'm inpatient!

The bottle presumably wouldn't be the problem - it's where the rear light
would go.

Easiest way I found was to get the parts to upgrade to T spec, then you get
the rack, built-in rear light and more stability when in parked position.

Has anyone mounted a bottle dynamo on an L5? If so where on the bike have
they mounted it?

    A number of people have suggested that there are not enough rides near
the end of the season so here goes!

    I will be hosting a combined Moultoneer/Folding society ride beginning
at my house in the village of Hazelbury Bryan near Sturminster Newton in
North Dorset, England at around 10.30 - 11.00 a.m. on October the 14th 2000

    The plan is for a gentle ride of around 30 miles in all to take in a
number of beautiful Dorsetshire villages and a longish lunch stop in
Sherborne, one of the finest small towns in the west country. Sherborne has
not one but TWO castles owned by Sir Walter Raleigh and lately by The Digby
Family (by lately I mean about 350 years or so)

    Our return route will be via the village of Yetminster which will allow
our train using friends to leave us and return home if they alighted here on
their arrival (I will send out routes to get to us from local stations and
from main centres by car to anyone who contacts me)

    On returning to Hazelbury we will, I Hope, be able to enjoy some tea and
cakes in the garden (house if wet) I hope that we will be back by about
3.30p.m. so that people can get back home at a reasonable time.

    Please join us if you can. we will be really pleased to see you and can
also help with local b&b's etc if you wish to make a West Country weekend of
it. The colours at this time of year can be really wonderful.

Contact me on the addresses below for more details

> Until you're knocked off it !

I know it's off topic but I can't resist!

1. A sleeping, eating or calling driver is much more likely to bump into
a car then into a two foot wide bicycle. In a car, you are always
exposed to bombardments of fast cars and giant trucks; on a bicycle you
can avoid those roads, or at least stay at their edge. The car's shell
offers protection against minor crashes, but increase the target for
major ones.

2. When you crash into something by your own mistake, speed is not
important.  The energy splashing through your body is, and it happens to
rise with the square of speed.  A car exhibits much greater speeds, so
is a lot more dangerous.  The protective measures are huge, but not
enough as we often see.  I think it's bizarre how, outside of sports,
drivers have only recently begun wearing helmets, and still only partial
ones (in the form of air bags).

If you ride defensively on a safe bicycle, like you would drive your
expensive car, I seriously doubt riding is more dangerous then driving. 
You can't know from statistics, because these throw in kids, sports and
risky leisure activities among the cyclists, whereas drivers are limited
to licensed grown-ups (at least physically) and mostly business use.

If I was doing so I would mount it on the right hand side of the 
front wheel. I would also set it to run on the rim. If it slips in 
heavy rain a gentle application of the brake will keep it going and 
make you more able to stop the bike quickly if needed.

I'm a newcomer to this list and not even yet an owner of a folding bike, (and
only  started riding a bike on holiday  in the last year- after.......hey near
enough  40 years). Most of the  posts i've been reading on this group  are over
my head in their level of technicality. So hope you all can tolerate my naive
contribution and enquiry.

I live in Hong Kong and am looking to buy a Brompton. Naturally the only ones
available are Taiwan-made. Having done  some research on the models and options
as described in  the UK catalogue and on various websites, I was looking for an
L5. However  the Bromptons I've been able find in a couple of bikeshops here,
seem to be 'composites'. Eg 3 gear models  seem to come only with rear carrier.
The 5-gear models  also only available with rear carrier and (front-only!?)
dynamo lamp. According to the catalogues the shopkeepers were able to show me
that seems to be about it as far as options go. I cant make out if the front
carrier bracket is  here, and from what I read it's convenience is a big plus.
I'm trying to track down the local agent/distributor to find out more.
So i guess i'm asking does anybody else on the list have a Taiwan model / have
any thoughts on the matter?
These bikes i've seen seem alot cheaper than UK/US prices, but then they  have
locally made tyres, brakes and God knows what other substandard bits.
As i say ideas and suggestions welcome.
Bill Telfer

It's not, I made out of what was written here over the years, and that

Yes, if you squirt the hood etc., and not the driver.  However, hitting the 
driver would be inevitable at some point.

Nevertheless, "otherwise" mentioned below still holds, don't you 
think?  And with cyclists a minority here [ In Philly its legal for us to 
ride on the sidewalks here as we don't occupy much real estate] its easy 
for driver votes to make life miserable for all others who just want to get 
from A to B; the vocal cycle advocates here have achieved what your squirt 
guns hopes to do with less damage ... maybe it should work elsewhere?

Someone from Japan said that they managed to fashion a carrier
block onto a Neobike Brompton, but it involved some drilling
into the frame.

I have two of the Taiwanese Bromptons (L3T). IMVAIO they are only
slightly lower quality than the old models of UK built Bromptons,
but a lot lower than the recent UK built Bromptons that fixed
some of the problems that people have been fixing themselves
for years, i.e. the lousy brakes, tires, etc. The lack of the
carrier block is a big minus IMVAIO, for many people. I thought
that Neobike had added the block, but maybe that's only in the
literature, not in reality.

I have often been curious about practical "paybacks" that
could be achieved when auto drivers do something egregious.
Often have wished I had a bar-mounted wide-angle camera
so I could take snaps and mail them to the local cops!

Squirting them with noxious substances has a certain appeal
(I would prefer essence of skunk myself, desiring to do
emotional damage more than property damage).  But I want
them to get a bloody ticket, dammit.

...

oh dear, someone said "stay in the bike lane"...  I totally 
agree that cyclists should obey prevailing road rules -- we are 
legally vehicles, after all.  scofflaw cyclists do cause 
problems.  But you can't just "stay in the bike lane" and be 
legal (or safe). 

how do you make (USA) a legal left from a bike lane, for 
example? across three lanes of traffic, say? nah, the bike has 
to work its way over to the left turn lane like anyone else.  
and this is perfectly legal, and it isn't "weaving through 
traffic," as long as you use proper signalling and due caution.  
and preferably a rear-view mirror! making your left from the 
bike lane would be suicidal and against code. 

CA highway code (USA) is pretty clear:  the bike is a vehicle 
and has a right to use the real lane, but it must pull over (as 
with any other slower traffic) if it impedes the progress of 
vehicles which are not travelling in excess of the local speed 
limit.  the bike lane gives us a "passing lane" for this 
purpose and that is great by me, especially on high-speed 
arterial roads. in dense urban/suburban street plans I am more 
skeptical.  

...

I'd be a bigger believer in bike lanes if they were, locally, 
more than a white line painted on the road that gives the City 
planners an excuse for ignoring all other bike facility and 
bike safety issues :-) Oh yes, and gives the local elected 
authorities a pretext for patting themselves on the back about 
how "bike friendly" their town is -- while they dump another 
$10M of public funds into giant parking garages to encourage 
people to drive to the local shops, and another $100M into road 
widening and freeway expansion.  "We gave you a bike lane, what
more do you want?" is what cyclists hear a lot.

Excuse my bitterness, but here's the reality of bike lanes
in my own home town (about 80K people, and completely
car-dominated).

Our bike lanes are unmaintained, especially at RR xings where 
there is significant paving damage.  Car drivers park in the 
bike lane (the city thoughtfully posts legal parking in the 
bike lane space, which reduces the working width of the lane to 
under 3ft, and to zero if someone opens the driver's door).
  
Drivers also use the bike lane for an illegal passing lane; 
cops use it to pull over drivers for a discussion/ticket; 
pedestrians and skateboarders use it as an extension of the 
sidewalk; the City uses it to store construction materials 
during road work; large storm drain grilles, utility covers, 
and other pointy dangerous works-dept stuff are all installed 
in the "bike lane" (out of the way of the cars, natch).  The 
street sweepers sweep all the broken glass and metal scraps 
into the bike lane (where it "doesn't matter").  

And of course the "bike lane" officially turns into a right 
turn lane for cars at every intersection; stay in the "bike 
lane" and you are blocking motorists turning right, or worse:  
racing them to the intersection. 

I'm glad -- no, sincerely I am -- that better bike lane 
enforcement has helped somewhat in Philly [I *bet* the cops 
there are not shy about citing cyclists; from what I hear, 
they're not shy about bashing heads either <grin>]. But on the 
whole, segregating cyclists from car traffic doesn't work as 
well (for me) as slowing the cars down and changing the car- 
centered urban design model.  

"Stay in your bike lane" just isn't safe, legal, or feasible a 
lot of the time (around here).  And given the inferior quality 
of the bike lane compared to the car roadway, it reads (to my 
irritable eye) like "stay in your ghetto" or "stay on your 
reservation" -- separate, but damn well not equal.  Harumph.  
Maybe the bike lanes in Philly are beautifully maintained, and 
cars really do get ticketed for violating the bike lane, and so 
forth -- but that ain't how it is here. Here the so-called 
"bike lane" is just spare bit of paving that bikes are allowed 
to use only as long as no one more important wants it.  Feh.

hope it's better elsewhere.  

sorry, forgive the rant -- either my buttons are more easily 
pushed lately or it's just a coincidence that several recent 
posts have been pushing 'em :-)  I acknowledge that I'm
only getting us further off topic...

on a brighter note, one of my faculty members here just
told me that he got a B as a gift and has fallen in love
with it, taking it all over the Bay Area.  his wife just
got one for herself.  so 2 more B riders in my town!

With the difference in cost being so great, the Taiwanese B is a good buy, 
faults and all.

No other folder folds as small and as quick, and the competing folders at 
this price range are the Dahons, which are far inferior.

If you're in Hong Kong, then email at petealex@netvigator.com. Been there
ten years and live in Yau Ma Tei. There's a Brompton bike man nearby, I can
show you where. However, finding a 5-speed in near impossible.

One word of warning, don't pay the prices they expect in Wanchai shops.
Those around Prince Edward are not bad, until you want parts or service. by
that time the shops are long gone.

Subject: Taiwan-made Bromptons


I'm a newcomer to this list and not even yet an owner of a folding bike,
(and
only  started riding a bike on holiday  in the last year- after.......hey
near
enough  40 years). Most of the  posts i've been reading on this group  are
over
my head in their level of technicality. So hope you all can tolerate my
naive
contribution and enquiry.

I live in Hong Kong and am looking to buy a Brompton. Naturally the only
ones
available are Taiwan-made. Having done  some research on the models and
options
as described in  the UK catalogue and on various websites, I was looking for
an
L5. However  the Bromptons I've been able find in a couple of bikeshops
here,
seem to be 'composites'. Eg 3 gear models  seem to come only with rear
carrier.
The 5-gear models  also only available with rear carrier and (front-only!?)
dynamo lamp. According to the catalogues the shopkeepers were able to show
me
that seems to be about it as far as options go. I cant make out if the front
carrier bracket is  here, and from what I read it's convenience is a big
plus.
I'm trying to track down the local agent/distributor to find out more.
So i guess i'm asking does anybody else on the list have a Taiwan model /
have
any thoughts on the matter?
These bikes i've seen seem alot cheaper than UK/US prices, but then they
have
locally made tyres, brakes and God knows what other substandard bits.
As i say ideas and suggestions welcome.

>> FROM WHAT I READ ABOUT THE STATES, IT WOULD NOT SURPRISE ME

no, that's the car drivers :-)

road rage, and all that....

"I have road rage.  I get enraged every time they build
 another road."  I forget who said this, some eco-geek
 in an online bike advocacy group.


what's more dangerous, driving or biking?

I decline to get into the bike safety argument in email
form, we could go on forever, but here's a URL with some
interesting stats/snips

http://www.ucolick.org/~de/AltTrans/helmbite.html

it's part of a contrarian political analysis of mandatory bike 
helmet laws in the US...  now go easy, folks, I'm not trying to 
start a flame war here.  we can all agree and disagree about 
bike helmets and helmet laws 'til the cows come home :-) but in 
the course of analyzing legislative responses to perceived 
risk, you have to analyze the risk itself --  so I did some 
research on cycling as a "risk activity" vs other common 
activities, and came up with some intriguing bits and pieces.  

also *very highly* recommended

http://www.kenkifer.com/bikepages/health/risks.htm

Ken's a good, informed, humorous ranter and a lifelong long- 
distance cyclist (in the USA, no less).  If you dig statistics, 
then the last 1/3 of this page should keep you happy for hours 
and hours.  Again, *you don't have to agree with Ken* about 
MHLs, to benefit from his very quotable analysis of cycling 
risk vs other everyday risks.  He has also written up some of 
his long-range bike camping trips in journal form -- hilarious 
and sometimes affecting reading.  

I know a woman who can't ride a bike because of a neck injury 
that makes the cycling position (on normal bikes) very painful.  
How did she get the permanent neck injury? In a very minor, 
teeny little rear-ender in a car.  Barely a dent to either car, 
but she has what looks to be a lifelong "minor" disablity.  
There's a moral in that story somewhere... but I'm not sure how 
to phrase it.   I'm going to lend her a recumbent soon and
see how that works out.
 
Hope to take my B to the outback of Texas next month.  but
not getting a rifle rack for the occasion :-)

For how bikes lanes should be, go to Denmark where they are painted blue at
road junctions. Motorists have to give way to cyclists. No-one breaks the
law because in the event of an accident - even if a cyclist is proved to be
drunk and is riding without lights - the driver is still held liable. Unfair
on drivers? Not really. They just take more care at junctions.

The 'revenge' thread is childish and irresponsible. Road rage is about as
irrational, unpredictable and potentially violent as anything one sees in
public. However badly a driver behaves, it is immensely foolish to try
anything in revenge, sweet (and justified) though that may be.

Subject: RE: Revenge is sweet


I have often been curious about practical "paybacks" that
could be achieved when auto drivers do something egregious.
Often have wished I had a bar-mounted wide-angle camera
so I could take snaps and mail them to the local cops!

Squirting them with noxious substances has a certain appeal
(I would prefer essence of skunk myself, desiring to do
emotional damage more than property damage).  But I want
them to get a bloody ticket, dammit.

...

oh dear, someone said "stay in the bike lane"...  I totally
agree that cyclists should obey prevailing road rules -- we are
legally vehicles, after all.  scofflaw cyclists do cause
problems.  But you can't just "stay in the bike lane" and be
legal (or safe).

how do you make (USA) a legal left from a bike lane, for
example? across three lanes of traffic, say? nah, the bike has
to work its way over to the left turn lane like anyone else.
and this is perfectly legal, and it isn't "weaving through
traffic," as long as you use proper signalling and due caution.
and preferably a rear-view mirror! making your left from the
bike lane would be suicidal and against code.

CA highway code (USA) is pretty clear:  the bike is a vehicle
and has a right to use the real lane, but it must pull over (as
with any other slower traffic) if it impedes the progress of
vehicles which are not travelling in excess of the local speed
limit.  the bike lane gives us a "passing lane" for this
purpose and that is great by me, especially on high-speed
arterial roads. in dense urban/suburban street plans I am more
skeptical.

...

I'd be a bigger believer in bike lanes if they were, locally,
more than a white line painted on the road that gives the City
planners an excuse for ignoring all other bike facility and
bike safety issues :-) Oh yes, and gives the local elected
authorities a pretext for patting themselves on the back about
how "bike friendly" their town is -- while they dump another
$10M of public funds into giant parking garages to encourage
people to drive to the local shops, and another $100M into road
widening and freeway expansion.  "We gave you a bike lane, what
more do you want?" is what cyclists hear a lot.

Excuse my bitterness, but here's the reality of bike lanes
in my own home town (about 80K people, and completely
car-dominated).

Our bike lanes are unmaintained, especially at RR xings where
there is significant paving damage.  Car drivers park in the
bike lane (the city thoughtfully posts legal parking in the
bike lane space, which reduces the working width of the lane to
under 3ft, and to zero if someone opens the driver's door).

Drivers also use the bike lane for an illegal passing lane;
cops use it to pull over drivers for a discussion/ticket;
pedestrians and skateboarders use it as an extension of the
sidewalk; the City uses it to store construction materials
during road work; large storm drain grilles, utility covers,
and other pointy dangerous works-dept stuff are all installed
in the "bike lane" (out of the way of the cars, natch).  The
street sweepers sweep all the broken glass and metal scraps
into the bike lane (where it "doesn't matter").

And of course the "bike lane" officially turns into a right
turn lane for cars at every intersection; stay in the "bike
lane" and you are blocking motorists turning right, or worse:
racing them to the intersection.

I'm glad -- no, sincerely I am -- that better bike lane
enforcement has helped somewhat in Philly [I *bet* the cops
there are not shy about citing cyclists; from what I hear,
they're not shy about bashing heads either <grin>]. But on the
whole, segregating cyclists from car traffic doesn't work as
well (for me) as slowing the cars down and changing the car-
centered urban design model.

"Stay in your bike lane" just isn't safe, legal, or feasible a
lot of the time (around here).  And given the inferior quality
of the bike lane compared to the car roadway, it reads (to my
irritable eye) like "stay in your ghetto" or "stay on your
reservation" -- separate, but damn well not equal.  Harumph.
Maybe the bike lanes in Philly are beautifully maintained, and
cars really do get ticketed for violating the bike lane, and so
forth -- but that ain't how it is here. Here the so-called
"bike lane" is just spare bit of paving that bikes are allowed
to use only as long as no one more important wants it.  Feh.

hope it's better elsewhere.

sorry, forgive the rant -- either my buttons are more easily
pushed lately or it's just a coincidence that several recent
posts have been pushing 'em :-)  I acknowledge that I'm
only getting us further off topic...

on a brighter note, one of my faculty members here just
told me that he got a B as a gift and has fallen in love
with it, taking it all over the Bay Area.  his wife just
got one for herself.  so 2 more B riders in my town!

Sorry to sound so serious, and your information from another web site is 
well taken, I considered the post in a playful tone, so forgive me if I 
sound like I'm debating the issue.

Philly has come from the pit for cyclist to a relatively good stance, for a 
city.  It may have lessons for others wishing to improve conditions in 
urban areas.

As for guns, yes, its a problem. Unlike cars, the recoil can unbalance a 
rider, and a proper weapon for us Yanks barely fits the front pannier! :)

Only when freewheeling? It sounds more like the whole inside mechanism having enough play to collide with the hubs shell. As this mechanism has pawls on the outside to lock into the shells inside it would have significantly less play with torque applied.

Wonderful web sites and a good read, but not being privy to how Failure 
Analysis made these calculations [they are a well respected accident 
investigative business], one issue is very strange in these statistics: if 
LIVING has a fatality rate of 1.53, how can the fatality rate be less for 
anything else?

It would seem LIVING provides the baseline fatality, and everything else 
modifies it, i.e.,

LIVING + Cycling
Living + Skydiving

etc.,


In data I previously posted for comparing cycling to auto deaths in 1998, 
the ratio is nearly 768:31,000 or ~ 1:40, in this data the ratio is much 
smaller, to the tune of .26:.47 or ~ 1:2.

Unlike a statistical manipulation that this data has undergone, the numbers 
I referred to earlier are raw data.

At least we see a demonstration on how numbers, can be juggled to show 
whatever you please.  Raw numbers are less insightful but free of 
transformations.

A clear point and well said, a good rant!  In the end the bike lane isn't 
want makes it better for bikes in Philly, its the bicycle advocacy group; 
your critique is sound, I believe it to be problem as you state, it was 
here too!  A bike lane is just a sign, the real solution is a vocal group 
of bike enthusiasts willing to solve the issues you pose, enforce the 
rules, and make sure the cyclists get a fair share.  There are a myriad 
side issues raised with each solution posed, so someone has to be there to 
smoothen the ripples from waves any action creates.

Laws are useless unless they're enforced and respected, so has been our 
recent problem with police abuse; but exposing and fixing it we did; the 
same goes for bike rights and rules.  It'll be quiet for the meantime, but 
when it rears it ugly head again, someone has to be there to set it right.

there's a real statistical nightmare in fatality stats
for transport, because of the "units" problem -- fatalities
per mile?  per hour?  per trip?  

and then, is it person miles or vehicle miles?  air travel
can be "safe" or "dangerous" depending on the units!

there's the known fact that owning a car encourages people
to drive further -- i.e. because they have it, they use it.

and that people who are committed to the car lifestyle will 
choose to live further from work, stores, etc -- whereas a 
committed velocipedestrian will deliberately choose to live 
closer to essential stuff.  the bike rider will achieve basic 
life goals while putting in fewer miles, so lifetime risk is 
skewed even if you figure fatalities per mile... it has been 
said that regardless of mode, people spend about the same 
amount of time commuting, shopping, whatever, so maybe per-hour 
is the meaningful estimate.  I dunno. 

in other words, it's a mess.  good luck figuring it out :-)

I think it's valuable to check the setting by approaching the setting gear
position from all possible ways. If say the setting gear is speed 2, then
select 2 from 1 then check. Then select 2 from 3 and re-check. The two
checks will be different but both should be within the correct range.

No, not really. You'd know how good a dynamo system is after you've had one
for a while. With batteries, there's always the risk they'll go flat when
you don't want them to. Not a problem with the dynamo.

Any regular exposure to fumes or dust will be a health hazard.

I rarely use public transport but as an example a 180 mile journey...

Car:

Convenient, door to door, stop when I like, choose a route I like etc. Cost
20

Train:

Inconvenient - only available at certain times of the day and on certain
days. Stops a few times, have to change trains (with all that luggage) once
or possibly twice. While waiting for connecting trains, the time wasted
makes the whole journey time comparable with going by car, can't control
your own environment (often too cold) and costs 35. For me, a realistic
cost would be 10 - cheaper than by car for the inconvenience of the system.

>

It costs me nothing to park at home or at my parents' house. I choose not to
park where it does cost extra.

The car of course is my own personal portable lockable storage space -
something public transport just can't provide.

So, the B is a speciality bike.

Can I add to the list that the B is:

A fun bike
A commuter's bike
A talking point
A work-horse
A bike for many ocassions
A multi-purpose bike...

And now it's your turn to add your purpose for the B !

afterthought: I think the "living" risk is some sort of average 
of all the risks, or of an "average lifestyle" or something 
like that.  

meaning -- if you did nothing, ever, but ummm water ski, 24 hrs 
a day, that would be less dangerous than ordinary living which 
includes eating (risk of choking on food) breathing (risk of 
cancer, emphysema, etc), walking (risk of falling down), 
talking (risk of saying something that upsets someone and 
getting a fatal punch in the nose?), etc. 

so it's correct that we have to *add* any risk onto the general 
risk of living...  of course living is infinitely risky, 
because everyone who has ever done it has eventually died :-) 

I think the real point of the actuarial table is that cycling
*adds* less risk to your life than water skiing, snowmobiling,
etc.  And less than driving.  per hour, anyway.

auto fatalities are so high in the us compared to bike 
fatalities because very few people spend many hours on bikes, 
whereas millions of people spend millions of hours in cars (ho 
hum).  the big raw numbers show that cars are a major killer.  
but the fatalities *per hour* show driving or riding in cars as 
only twice as risky as biking... in theory, if everyone biked 
exactly the same number of hours that they drove, there would 
only be 2x as many fatalities for cars as there are for bikes.  

I think the numbers game breaks down at this speculative 
point, however, because one of the reasons for car fatalities 
is too many cars.  if people drove less and biked more, there 
would be fewer fatalities all round! so *all* fatalities would 
decline.  note the finding from the WHO that if cars were 
completely separate from bikes (that apartheid I was just 
complaining about) the bike would be 500x safer, not 2x 
safer... 

One thing that is quite useless about this actuarial table --
it does not tot up the risk you pose to *others* by doing
activity X.  What risk are you adding to a bystander's life
as you snowmobile, etc?  I'd guess the passenger car rates
pretty high on that scale as there are more bystanders on
the streets than out on a lake or a snowmobile track. 

Brompton cyclists, of course, run a higher risk than most
of Dreaded Folder Finger Pinch, but it's not fatal 
(fortunately!)

...

oh, we gotta get off this safety topic...  I'm still looking 
for the perfect folding lightweight trailer for a B.  how about 
the Ruxxack hand cart, with some kind of simple hitch, has 
anyone considered this?   it's very light and folds flatter
than you would believe.

Is it my imagination or do North Americans not use the word motorist?
Auto-drivers is rather clumsy.

At what time do the British Bromptons improve in quality? Is this a gradual

I've got a week's holiday at Halloween and I've booked a ticket to Miami.
Normally I'd hire a car and drive north. However it occurs to me that I
could just as well take my B. and save on the car hire.
Question:
A nice part of the US where cycling should be fun at the end of October,
where the roads aren't crowded or dangerous and where I can find interesting
towns, villages or hamlets to stop at regular intervals?
Hills aren't really a problem; I made a policy decision years ago that I
would never sweat my way up a hill - and the B's the easiest of bikes to
alight from.

I'm sure there's a good reason.  However, that's the problem with massaging 
the numbers with many denominators and multipliers: fatalities/million 
hours, interpreting it becomes more abstract; the raw data is easier to 
communicate and interpret.

The data is strange and thus, rather than speculate, the ORIGINAL authors 
should explain what these numbers mean; sadly, this risk chart has been

In contrast, using raw numbers, Canadian stats are similar to the US:
http://www.casm-acms.org/Committees/Sport%20Safety/Sport%20Safety%20Frames/Cycling/Heltext.htm

Where they give 100-130 deaths annually; if I may be so bold to as compare 
the entire population of Canada and the US, then we have 130/30M versus 
758/270M giving 4.3 and 2.8 cyclist killed per million population for 
Canada and the US respectively.  That's for comparing the countries, each 
state or province is another story [ for Canada, 1/3 of population live in 
Ontario and thus, has greater risk than Nunavut

As this seems to reflect my own attitude, would it follow  that a 3-gear model
will be adequate for me, or conversely, 5 gears might get me up a small hill or
two  with as little sweat?

All the stats quoted here miss the issue. You cannot compare "exposure
hours" to come to conclude that bike travel is much safer than going by car.
If the fatalities per miles travelled are compared I'm sure that the car is
one of the safest forms of transport, with the bicycle trailing far behind.
I have, however, not researched the subject and cannot back up this "gut
feeling" with hard data.

Unfortunately you have interpreted the stats incorrectly - you are 
using unfactorised numbers (that is your "denominator"). The 
important issue is - What is your chance of being killed for each 
mile you travel?

If you knew the number of bikes & cars in the population & the number 
of miles they travel per annum then did the comparison you would 
probably would never use a bike again!

Anyone got the figures?

Number of bikes in the population say = A
Average number of miles they travel per annum = B
Number of cars in the population = C
Average number of miles they travel per annum = D

	(C x D)/(A x B) = the risk factor 

eg A=1 B=10 C=10 D=100
	(10 x 100)/(1 x 10) = 1000/10 = 100
Therefore you would be 100 times more likely to be killed on your 
bike than car.

Anyone got any figures?!

Cycles lanes around here are improving.  Some are red the full length, others 
are just shown with a painted line, but they are painted red where side roads 
meet and at traffic lights.

I agree with Ian - I never (well almost never) respond to agression. 
I may have to meet the person/vehicle again. The people are usually 
bigger than me -& and as the man who was going to knock Arthur Dents 
house down when Arthur was laying in front of it said "Do you know 
how much damage that bulldozer would get if I let it run over you? - 
None at all."

I can vouch for this - BUT - all the improvements end at the most 
dangerous points i.e where roads narrow, in the middle of a busy 
road or at a roundabout. Near here some traffic calming has taken 
place by put edge of road obstructions in but NO cycle slot so the 
cyclist has to join in, with unfavourable odds, to get through the 
gap with traffic in both directions.

On my bike (1997 T5; one cable gearchange) the adjustment works best if
*not* set up as per manual. As was pointed out by another listmember the red
mark on the indicator rod needs to be fully visible (just outside) the rear
axle when adjusting in second gear. Going by the manual results in sudden
gearchanges under load; something which cannot be too beneficial for the
life expectancy of the hub.

I think it's valuable to check the setting by approaching the setting gear
position from all possible ways. If say the setting gear is speed 2, then
select 2 from 1 then check. Then select 2 from 3 and re-check. The two
checks will be different but both should be within the correct range.

Set it up by the manual - you can't go by experience from 1 bike & 
extrapolate!! There are manufacturing differences. Once you know what 
setting your bike needs use that - as in Willi's case.

Fully agree. But bear in mind that when the adjustment according to manual
does not seem to work there might be a position sligtly off the recommended
one that cures the problem. So if you have problems, give it a try.

I've always (well for 20 years) been a 5 speed hub fan, but last night I
swapped the 5 speed hub for a spare 3 speed wheel as the former needs  a
strip down having 'lost' 2nd and 4th gears.  After gettng everything back
on, I just just whizzed the little adjusting nut until the cable was a bit
slack in top gear and away it went, all three gears functioning.  Clearly a
price is paid for the occasional ease of getting up those underpass ramps in
super low or flying down hill in super top.  Still think the old 2 cable hub
was easier to deal with on the Brompton

I've just been confronted with the challenge of teaching my sister's 6 and 8
year old daughters to ride a bike. Has anyone experience of using a B for
this purpose? If the saddle can be lowered sufficiently, is there any
particular reason why it would otherwise NOT be suitable?

If the consensus is that it's suitable, you can add 'teaching aid' to the
list.

So, the B is a speciality bike.

Can I add to the list that the B is:

A fun bike
A commuter's bike
A talking point
A work-horse
A bike for many ocassions
A multi-purpose bike...

And now it's your turn to add your purpose for the B !

You are presumably referring to UK - my experience of Denmark (and Sweden)
is that these omissions are not made. UK has some splendidly laughable
examples of bike lanes, such as the 3 yard one near Brighton station.

I can vouch for this - BUT - all the improvements end at the most
dangerous points i.e where roads narrow, in the middle of a busy
road or at a roundabout. Near here some traffic calming has taken
place by put edge of road obstructions in but NO cycle slot so the
cyclist has to join in, with unfavourable odds, to get through the
gap with traffic in both directions.

Yes! The cycle lanes often stop exactly where you start needing them! I 
spoke to our local Council Cycling Officer about this (he rides a 
bike!) and he agreed but says his hands are tied by highways. Where 
it's too narrow they refuse to take away lanes or pedestrian areas. But 
he showed me places where they have used some ingenious ways to make it 
work, and their own targets suggest they have to do much more.

Again no hard data, but I read lately that mile-for-mile a cyclist in the UK 
is 17 times more likely to be killed on the roads than any other category of 
road user.

My nearly seven year old daughter can ride me Brompton, but she is VERY large 
for her age. And even so she finds the brakes very hard to reach.

She's been riding confidently for nearly two years now (on her own bike) and 
once she'd got the hang of pedalling with stabilisers I got her riding without 
in just one week. I got her to ride down a gentle slope, first with me 
supporting, and later on her own. She gradually got further and further 
without having to stop and put her feet down, and then it clicked. 

You might be OK with a Brompton as long as the seat is all the way down and 
the handlebars are adjusted to be lower (swung back).  But make sure the 
brakes can be reached as these are important for confidence!

BTW When my daughter hits the switch to bring the Zap online it leaps 
forwards! Power to weight is very important. :-)

I'll assume important for me, not for society. Tranport policy planners
should chase a different goal.

1. I wouldn't like major injuries either - BTW, in Belgium, I believe
people dying one month after an accident are not considered killed on
the road.

2. MY chance, so probably not an average over all people on a bicycle.
Divide the group into categories and show me how the chance varies among
them.  If it varies little, I'll accept the average.

3. So I don't care much for an average for each mile travelled (for
utilitarian travels, this should be miles covered).  Noone is devoted to
one type of vehicle for all miles travelled.  Divide the travels into
categories and see how the chance varies among them.  I will alter the
route or vehicle used for the dangerous travels, not all of them.

Of course, this becomes terribly complicated and is probably a waste of
time anyway.

Many thanks for the observations. In light of what you say (child rather
small), I'll try and find her a suitable conventional bike on which to
learn. But it isn't that easy these days - most children's bikes I see now
are scaled down ersatz-MTB's with 'full suspension' (really useful for a
child's bike, I don't think) and a confusingly and unnecessarily large array
of derailleur. Reluctant to buy used bike from boot sale as I've probably
encouraged someone to continue stealing (or am I being too cynical?)

There was a scaled down version of the mini-Moulton made by Triang, probably
not available in Dk.

Don't want to spoil your holiday, but Florida is one of the worst States for
cycling (although VERY flat).  It is quite unsafe to cycle there compared to
many other places.

For October (presuming it doesn't snow!) and Fall in the USA, you can't beat
New England.  There are Youth Hostels there too!

        Bob

> At what time do the British Bromptons improve in quality?

One fine day in March 2000. There have been smaller improvements along
the way, but that day marked a giant leap for folding mankind.

I have an S-A sprinter leaflet. The key steps in gear adjustment are:

  5. Select second gear on the gear control and rotate
  the pedal crank to ensure the gear is fully engaged. 
  Turn the cable adjuster until the centre of the raised boss at
  the end of the indicator rod is level with the end of the axle.

  6. Tighten the locknut against the adjuster.

  7. Select 5th gear, rotate the pedal crank, change back to
  second gear and check adjustment.

Steps 1..4 are more for initial set-up than subsequent re-adjustment.

My indicator rod has a narrow section painted red rather than a
raised boss, but I assume they are equivalent indicator marks.
I prefer to adjust so that rather more than half of the indicator
mark is outside the axle, on the basis that it will then take
longer for cable stretch to lead to a need for re-adjustment.
This also makes the cable a bit tighter in first gear, which could
help with selection of first gear, which is rarely immediate.

I imagine that if the gear wheels that mesh for second gear have
been damaged due to excessive use when adjustment is needed to
overcome cable stretch, then having the whole of the indicator
mark outside the axle might be useful, but not otherwise.

BTW I remain sceptical about reported preferences for play in the
bearings, particularly assuming they are ball, not roller, bearings,
which are likely to suffer undue wear if not somewhat preloaded.
If a hub needs play to work OK, it is probably on its last legs.

David :)
