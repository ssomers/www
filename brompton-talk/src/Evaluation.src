# Can you really ride more than 10 miles on that thing?
  <UL>
  <LI>{Andrew Brooks, Jul 1998}
    I've just bought a new &pound;800.00 mountain bike (Bontrager Privateer - LX/STX
    groupset, V-brakes, front suspension etc) to do some off road riding.
    It's interesting just how good the Brompton ride is in comparison (on the
    road). The MTB wins on rigidity, weight and 'feeling of strength', but by
    God the Brommy is quick off the mark and very manoeuvrable.
    I had feared my pleasure in the Brompton would be compromised by my new
    steed, but not at all. I'd still choose to ride it around town, just for
    the ride.
  <LI>{Mike Hessey, May 2000}
    I did 60 miles in a day on a more or less standard Brompton T5 a few years
    back and  didn't suffer any repercussions- I THINK I had a Brooks Swift
    (Titanium) saddle at that time.

#frail It's frail, isn't it?
  After someone at Bike Friday headquarters was alleged to have suggested this...
  <UL>
  <LI>{Deborah Eacock, Oct 1999}
    Consider the source of this comment.  The disturbing comment that I have
    heard is that Bike Friday, due to the lack of suspension acting on many
    pivot points and quick releases, tend to get loose and sloppy with much
    use.
    <BR>
    The Metro is BF's cheapest model and does not fold.
    <BR>
    The Brompton IS NOT frail. I have used my T5 constantly for more than three
    years in all conditions.  It is still tight and reliable as when new.  I am
    6'2", 165#, with the long seat-post.  My Moulton Mark 3 is rock-solid, but
    it does not fold.
  <LI>{De Clarke, Oct 1999}
    Hmm, I am on the heavy side and I don't feel as if my
    Bromi is "frail" -- in fact it seems very sturdily
    engineered, which accounts for its own not-insignificant
    weight :-)
  <LI>{Rob Cope, Oct 1999}
    No, as the Portly sub-genus of Brompton riders can confirm.
    <BR>
    I've broken various bits of a 1993 frame.  Covered by guarantee & the
    newer frame parts are tougher (though usually lighter) than originals.
    When Brompton refer to 'constant development' on the leaflets, it's
    meant for real.
    <BR>
    Anyone worried that I  have broken frame bits should appreciate that I
    dish out serious abuse levels: trailer hauling, down chalk pits, rough
    paths...  If the factory ever shivers at what some of us do to their
    little bikes, it doesn't show.   Presumably the strengthening process is
    accelerated by us plump types straining things.
    <BR>
    Nothing's unbreakable, including Fridays.  These had a briefly poor
    reputation in UK some years ago, as one small batch came in with weak
    stems.  Long resolved, I hasten to add, & the various Fridays are
    excellent bikes: just don't fold as small & neat as a Brom.
    <BR>
    Also, I don't see Dave Holladay switching to Fridays.  Nuff said.
  <LI>{sdf, Oct 1999}
    I have owned both a Bike Friday New World Tourist and a Brompton L5. I
    recognise that one can get into a semantic argument about the meaning of the
    word 'frail'; however, one of the things I really disliked about the Bike
    Friday was that it felt loose and rattled a lot whereas the Brompton feels
    solid. I accept that the two bikes are made for different purposes but the
    Brompton in regular use has a very solid feel.
  <LI>{Stephen Casey, Oct 1999}
    "Solid"?  Did you say "the Brompton feels solid"?  I won't get into a
    "semantic argument" over the word "frail", but please define "solid".  If
    you want my opinion about the stock Brompton (I have an L5 for what it is
    worth) it is a piece of . . . no, no let's not say that . . . let's just say
    it is NOT "solid".  I should say that I am a frequent user of the Brompton,
    however, and am ever-amazed at how little engineering improvements have been
    made to make this bike a truly "solid" design.  Rarely a day goes by that I
    am not fidgeting, tightening, or bending something to get it to run.  I say
    just bring along a 10 lb (that's about 4.5 kg) tool set and you'll be fine.
  <LI>{Chris Newport, Oct 1999}
    I've had a Brompton L5 for 2.5 years and I've put over a thousand miles
    on it riding canal towpaths and commuting in London.
    <BR>
    I now also have a Berndes [the German folder Bernds??].
    <BR>
    My take on the 'frailty' of the Brompton is that it flexes more than
    some folders and I have the impression that rear subframe and 16" wheels
    are quite highly stressed carrying my 200-odd pounds weight, almost all
    the weight being on the rear wheel.  Certainly the Berndes feels rock
    solid in comparison (in fact more than some cumbersomes I've owned).
    <BR>
    But the Brompton frame is designed to withstand that stress.  The
    'frailty' is largely a perception based on appearance and the small
    amount of movement that is designed in to absorb the stresses.
  <LI>{Ian Charles, Oct 1999}
    To me, the Brompton feels like a conventional bike (in the best sense). I
    fail to understand how anyone can describe it as 'frail' - on the contrary,
    I wonder sometimes whether it needs to be quite as 'solid' and if some
    further weight gains could be made. OK, I'm nearer the 150 pound mark and
    maybe heavier and taller folk don't find it as comfortable. But surely with
    the various adjustments possible, the Brompton must suit all but the most
    extreme persons in terms of height/weight?
  <LI>{Stringer, Mark, Oct 1999}
    I was thinking about this last night as I rolled along the Hudson
    River on a "under construction" bike path. Over gravel, dirt and pavement I
    the bike felt good. It's no mountain bike, but seems to be able to handle
    the often bumpy, pot-holed streets of Manhattan. Also, it can withstand the
    forces incurred when climbing very steep hills. My Strida could never make
    the climb from 125 st to 110 st on Broadway, it would've collapsed.
    <BR>
    	So after 6 days of Manhattan rough rides, I'd say solid
  <LI>{David Edge, Oct 1999}
    I don't recall Brompton ever having to do a product recall, and I rather
    fancy that Friday once did.
    [In 2002, Brompton sort of recalled the handlebars on older models]
  <LI>{Custfold, Oct 1999}
    There are weak points in any bike design.  The original Brompton which John
    Grimshaw bought for Sustrans split at the seat clamp but was re-welded and
    used by the late David Groome for many years - and the 1988 series of
    Bromptons moved the clamp to the back of the seatpost.
    <BR>
    I have had rear frames fail (6 or 7) - less since the design was changed to
    remove stress raisers, and I also had bracing added at weak point.
    <BR>
    I have had main frames smile (fail) (3 - although all but one were 1988
    design without the reinforced weld)
    <BR>
    I have had front main frames fail (4-6) and cured this with reinforced front
    frame.
    <BR>
    I have had luggage blocks shear off the bolts (carrying 30 Kg or more though)
    <BR>
    The old seatposts bent and used to eventually snap of the tops - cured by my
    pre production concept of an extending post.
    <BR>
    Oh and handlebars - cured by using steel ones.
    <BR>
    But be aware that I [@Custfold] used to break one conventional frame a year anyway.
  </UL>

  # Yes but I'm <EM>really</EM> heavy...
  <UL>
  <LI>{Paul Brady ATT, Jan 2000}
    Well, I way 205lbs and I carry a laptop and sometimes a gym bag, all that is
    about 250lbs, and I have not had a problem yet, except keeping it all on the
    bike.
  </UL>
  [Post scriptum from the maintainer of this site:
   in 2001, my Brompton's frame turned out to be overstressed.
   I was blamed for causing the problem, but no clear causes were identified.
   After more than eight months and some arguments, it was replaced virtually for free.
   The frame lived some 5 years and travelled less than 5000km.
   I weighed "only" 85 kg.
   I use that Brompton only a few times a year anymore.

  # Frame material
    <UL>
    <LI>{Custfold}
       The Brompton's mild steel construction is a real saving grace when, like me
       you punish it.  Cromo frames I have ridden usually fracture about once a
       year, instantly and catastrophically.  Mild steel has plenty of helpful grain
       boundaries and crack stoppers, and MS frames have a pleasant habit of
       deforming to extraordinary contortions before a gentle tearing of the
       remaining section gives a catastrophic failure.  I am on my third main frame,
       but with my record of destroying conventional bikes
       [@Custfold]
       the performance of the Brompton is exceptional.
       Useful indicators are the way in which the paint
       film lifts around a crack - any unexplained shedding of paint should be
       checked thoroughly, and the frame will distort sufficiently to make riding
       feel very odd - crab like - well before you are likely to get dumped
       gracefully on the road.  Brompton have been very helpful in analysing any
       problems, and this has usually resulted in design improvements where a
       potential long term stress raiser for the less strenuous rider is
       highlighted.  If you start bashing pedals on corners, check the main frame
       for possible distortion.  If the rear hinge, or connections to it fail the
       bike can still be 'ridden' with care by tying this hard on to the main bike.

# Can tall people ride a Brompton?
  {Andy Cohen}
    When I go shopping for a non-folding bicycle, I make sure to buy the
    right size for my body. I'm just tall enough (6' 2") to make it hard to
    find a used bicycle that fits me comfortably.
    <BR>
    I'm thinking about buying a folding bicycle, but each of them seems to
    come in only one size. Are they somehow more adjustable than non-folding
    bicycles, or do taller and smaller people just put up with the lack of
    different bike sizes for the sake of the folding feature?
  <UL>
  <LI>{Steven D. Hanel}
    They are extremely more adaptable than a normal wedgie. Bromptons have a
    larger seat post if the standard doesn't fit. The Bike Friday is built
    for you to your preferences. The Dahon's are pretty broad range of fit
    but I don't think they have additional fitting options.
  <LI>{Channell Wasson}
    Andy, The Brompton is a one size fits all machine.
    Although the fit may not be perfect.
    The adjustment takes place through the seat tube or pillar being
    positioned comfortably for a reasonable reach to the pedals.
    The taller you are the more you may have to lean forward to reach
    the handle bars.
    People from 5' to 6' 5" have purchased Bromptons and have found them
    satisfactory after a break-in period.
  <LI>{Stein Somers}
    Last weekend, after 1 month on the Brompton and 600km under its wheels,
    I tried my good "normal", size 63 light touring bike again.
    I wasn't particularily impressed by the sitting comfort and found the
    gigantic wheels quite silly.
    <BR>
    I also compared the sitting position, with aligned pedal axis:<BR>
    <UL>
    <LI>the Brompton saddle is 4cm more to the rear because the frame
      tube is fixed behind the bottom bracket and not on it,
      while the angle of the seat tube and pillar is identical;
    <LI>the front wheel is 2cm less to the front;<BR>
    <LI>the rear wheel is 5cm less to the rear.
    </UL>
  <LI>{Leonard Rubin}
    The easiest, cheapest solution is to add a quick release to the
    handlebar/stem interface. It is absolutely essential that only one that is
    well-matched to the job in terms of strength, quality and geometry be used,
    as this is a rather critical bolt! I sell a proprietary one that is
    particularly well-suited to the job, but if you tend to be mechanically
    careless or absent-minded (you probably know if that's a fair description
    of you), then it's a bad idea altogether. If you are tuned in to
    adjustments, it's a fantastic addition, as it lets you achieve the much
    more efficient (and in my own, American opinion, much more comfortable for
    all but the shortest, flattest rides) standard, slightly stretched position,
    compared to the nearly bolt-upright one dictated by the bar position
    required for folding. The penalty is one additional step in the folding
    procedure (return bars to upright position), but that's a small price to
    pay!
    <BR>
    I leave the brake levers just a tad loose, so that I can swivel them into
    the ideal position, as well, but this is a very dicey area in which to be
    tossing about recommendations, so I never said it!
  <LI>{Rob Cope, Jul 1998}
    I am 6'2 as well and use a Brompton every day.  Yes, it would be nice to
    have a slightly longer reach (to match my Moulton Deluxe) and the very
    upright position is about as aerodynamic as a brick.  But I do not find it
    uncomfortable, even for longer distances (though I think 'horses for
    courses' applies in spadeloads).  You will need the extended seatpost,
    possibly the adjustable telescopic version plus a decent saddle.  And it is
    an acquired taste: first time I tried a Brompton, I could not deal with the
    light handling and apparent back-heaviness.  Now I revel in the nippy
    manoeuvrability.  Borrow or hire one for the weekend, preferably with the
    clip-on front bag, then decide if the plusses for the minuses win out.
  <LI>{Stein Somers, Jul 1998}
    I'm 6'5"/ 1m96, spend almost an hour a day on the telescopic seat post, and
    would also like higher handlebars.  I've mounted L-shape bar ends so as
    to higher the steering bar a luxurious 15 cm.  However the brakes and
    bells are too far away for city traffic, and I have to unlock and twist
    the left bar end to make the handlebars fold (where it serves to retain
    the handlebars unlike the underpowered clip).
    <BR>
    The soon to be produced recumbent kit features a higher stem, but it is
    meant for that laid back position where the legs and not the arms hold
    one's body back.  It has been suggested here that Brompton warranty
    fades when you change anything to the stem or handlebars; indeed the
    stem bolt has some a "marking paint" on it.  I wonder if there is an
    agreement about this issue between Juliana Neuss and Brompton?
    <BR>
    By the way the Birdy's special telescopic stem reaches only an inch
    higher than the Brompton's ordinary stem, on the other hand the straight
    bar doesn't get in the way of one's knees.  
  <LI>{Phil Gough, Oct 1998}
    I had the good fortune to buy my T5 from a 6 foot 4 in or so guy who
    found the handlebar to saddle distance too short for his sense of security.
    He bought the machine but didn't persevere with it so I got a new-condition machine
    and accessories at a big discount.
    I would guess that it is leg length that is the problem, and people of course vary a lot
    in this measurement.
  <LI>{Willi Mindak, Oct 98}
    I'm about the same height (1.86m), and I weight quite a bit more.
    If the Brompton is equipped with the telescopic seat post, and the saddle is moved back a bit
    I find the seating position tolerable, even on longer runs (I do the occasional 25 mile run).
    It is a bit too upright, though, and consequently the air resistance is quite noticeable.
    I find that out of the saddle work is too cramped to be maintained for any length of time.
    <BR>
    I actually prefer the more upright stance the Brompton forces me into, because I'm beyond
    the first flush of youth, and who wants to do his back in?
    The crank- arm length is o.k. for taller riders, but beware of kerbs and corners.
    When pedalling through even a mild curve the inside pedal hits the ground with sometimes comic,
    sometimes more serious consequences (I have the scars to prove it).
    For that reason I would not recommend longer cranks.
  <LI>{Mr Bob Imrie, Oct 1998}
    I am 6'4" (no I didn't sell Phil his bike) and I find my T5 (with its
    extended seat pillar) perfectly comfortable. But I ride it very sedately
    and leisurely. It's not one for a racing angle!

  # Honking up a hill
  <UL>
  <LI>{Stein Somers, Feb 2000}
    I wonder if any of the taller, stronger readers can "honk" on a
    Brompton, if I picture it correctly?  It's anatomically impossible for
    my 1m96 body to raise out of a Brompton's saddle and pedal uphill.
  <LI>{Mark James, Feb 2000}
    I don't so much Honk as swing the bike from side to side with my rather nifty
    super stubbie bar ends. Its makes a difference on the steeper hills, I tend
    to use the gears more i.e. down into 2nd at every stop and whizzzzzz I'm away.
    I am 186 cm and 75 kg and have tilted the handlebars forward and non standard
    saddle right back, although with Cateye Lamp my knees knock against it if
    I'm nay careful

  <LI>{Bob Imrie, Jul 1999}
    My son David, now nearly 9, took to my Bromp T5 at the end of the last
    Ventrnor FF. I bought him a secondhand red L5 shortly after, and he has
    ridden it ever since. He has gradually raised the seat pillar as he has
    grown (he's now 4 feet 10 inches!) and also has the handlebars angled
    towards him. As a parent it would have cost a fortune to equip him with a
    new pseudo mountain bike every year, so the money on the L5 was well spent.
  <LI>{Chris Newport, Jul 1999}
    My 3 daughters - ages 10, 13, 16 - all borrow my B from time to time.
    <BR>
    The (average sized) 10 y.o. has to have the seat post very low, to the
    point where the bottom of the post is near the ground and the bike
    cannot do first fold.
    <BR>
    This and the (not ideal even for me) near vertical position of the brake
    levers, plus the force the brakes need to operate, is the limiting
    factor.  I would guess 9 or 10 is the earliest a child could *safely*
    ride a B.

# Won't it fold while riding?
  {Carlos Cortes, Sep 1997}
    [The back wheel assembly swinging underneath as easily as deploying a kick 
    stand] 
    sounds a little unstable.  What happens if you go off a curve or 
    over bumpy terrain?  Doesn't it bang against its unfolded support?
  <UL>
  <LI>{Anthony Cartmell, Sep 1997}
    When unfolded the rear wheel assembly presses against a rubber block,
    which compresses when you sit on the bike.  This provides suspension to
    make the ride more comfortable.
    <BR>
    Unless you plan on cycling off cliffs the rear suspension won't fold
    while you are riding the bike.  On bumpy terrain the rubber suspension
    block absorbs the bumps quite well, but stays very compressed by your
    weight on it.
  <LI>{Peter Amey, Sep 1997}
    the same pivoting section is what provides the rear 
    suspension.  There is absolutely no problem with this arrangement in 
    practice and, if it really troubled someone, a simple strap round the 
    seat post can be used to hold the rear section in place.  I have never 
    felt the need to do this.
  <LI>{Megan Lynch, Sep 1997}
    I have ridden off of curbs many times, sometimes even with loads on the
    rack.  It has never been a problem.  The only time the rear assembly
    bothers me is when I'm trying to pick the bike up and turn it while walking
    alongside it and navigating narrow locations.  I have learned to put my
    foot under the tire to nudge it while I lift and turn.

  <LI>{Ian Charles, Dec 1999}
    I like riding out of the pedal [sic] sometimes - if only to gain more power
    climbing a hill or against the wind (some time ago a previous contributor
    made an interesting suggestion that Europeans tend to push harder in higher
    gears even if it means pedalling more slowly while Americans go for cadence
    and easier gears); in any event, doing this with the Brompton definitely
    feels awkward at first but one eventually does get used to the slightly more
    wobbly contraptions beneath.
  <LI>{Paul Brady ATT, Dec 1999}
    You will get used to the feeling of standing on the Bromie.  It is a little
    strange at first but after some time you will get the hang of it.

# Is it slow?
  <UL>
  <LI>{Andrew Henry}
    I haven't done any touring on a Brompton per se.  However, I find
    that I am usually about 30% slower on a Brompton than on a
    decent touring bike on typical journeys.  I suspect that some of
    this is because there is less incentive to push so hard when the
    riding position is upright.
    <BR>
    In practice, a Brompton might well be an awful lot faster if you
    can use public transport every so often.
  <LI>{Stein Somers}
    I've consistently measured a 10% delay, although these latest months
    I'm actually leveling with my old records.
  <LI>{Andrew Brooks, Jul 1997}
    It's never occurred to me before but the bike has tremendous acceleration.

    I would like to wait for my other MTB, which uses the same type of computer.
    I was "fresh" on the B, and I was a bit 'peeked' on the MTB, having just done
    a 9 mile "sprint".  But, the impute controls should have negated "lack of
    energy".  Still, since these results seem to counter my assumptions, (and I
    usually use the other MTB), I won't call the results definitive.

    Anyway, would anyone like to buy a used mountain bike?
  <LI>{Richard Lighton, Jul 1999}
    Some rather less formal results: Arnold (my T5, 12% reduced gears)
    recently made me join the local touring bike club. They have various
    categories of rides, so I started with C (for average cyclists). Did
    a couple of nice pleasant rides (25 miles or thereabouts) and Arnold
    had no trouble at all keeping up. Given an upslope (nothing very long
    or very steep) I had to hold him back or (a couple of times) let him
    zoom uphill and then wait at the top.
    <BR>
    On Sunday (July 4th, US holiday, parades and such) the club organized
    a parade ride. Decorate your bike, wear red, white, and blue, and join
    this mass of bikes rolling through various towns in advance of or behind
    their parade. 25 miles with categories from A (the sort of people who
    do 100 miles in 5 hours) down to C* ("solid cyclists"). Again, a fairly
    easy route and not going at A pace, but Arnold was up with the lead group
    for 18 miles before the front tire went flat :-( Maybe he was fed up
    with having to carry a couple of small US flags sticking out of the
    springs of his Brooks saddle. (Come on Arnold, forgive me please for
    this lack of patriotic support).
    <BR>
    Yesterday (holiday observed) he went on another C ride. Well, there were
    only 7 turned up and someone was late and part of the group waited and
    three of us set off. We went substantially faster than C pace. Arnold
    and his 5 gears was only in trouble on upslopes where the speed fell
    just below 15 mph, and I had to drop a gear. The gap between 4th and
    3rd is too wide--I can't pedal fast enough uphill to maintain 14mph
    in 3rd, so we would slowly fall behind and have to pedal a bit harder
    to catch up downhill or on the flat.
    <BR>
    All very unscientific in measuring the capabilities of a Brompton,
    and my legs are presumably in better condition than I expected, but
    it does show that a perfectly ordinary Brompton is a fine vehicle.
    I can't compare it to other bikes. I don't have any.
    Why would I <EM>want</EM> another?
    (Well, maybe a nice NS Moulton or one of Len Rubin's
    modified Bromptons or some half step gearing--but the last two would be
    Arnold upgrades anyway)

# Speeding on a Brompton
  {Carl J. Grillmair, Oct 1998}
    I would prefer something capable of handling the 5 mile, 40-45 mph
    morning descents to my workplace. Would this be out of the
    question (or at least ludicrously dangerous) on the Brompton?
  <UL>
  <LI>{Bob Gelman, Oct 1998}
    Birdy has V-brakes which will effectively stop you
    (being near San Francisco's very big descents I can personally testify to that),
    not merely slow you down.
    This could save your life if, for example, a car suddenly pulled out of a driveway
    on your trip down the mountain.
    Moreover, the Birdy's suspension could be an advantage if the small wheels of a folder
    hit a "pothole" at that speed during your descent.
  <LI>{Channell Wasson, Oct 1998}
    For me I won't let it out full speed unless I know the road is good all the way.
    You must know the road to your work well by now.
    I find the Brompton rock solid going down hill.
    I have rolled down the back side of Monitor Pass in the Sierras of California
    at over 50 mph and I felt very secure.
    On my full sized road bike I take such speeds in mortal fear of a front wheel shimmy starting up.
    The Brompton gave no sign of this and gave a very stable ride.

# Touring on a Brompton?
  <UL>
  <LI>{Andrew Henry}
    I have only ever carried luggage on my Brompton with the front
    pannier bag (@cloth_pannier).  Even when this is stuffed full with heavy shopping,
    it doesn't have a big effect on the handling.  Carrying luggage
    on the rear of a Brompton might not affect the handling much either
    as it is pretty low down.  It will however totally mess up the folding
    of the bike until you remove it !
    <BR>
    If you want a bike that you can ride for long distances whilst
    touring, then a proper touring bike might be better.  I don't
    find my Brompton uncomfortable, but over long distances,
    being 30% slower can make the difference between getting home
    before or after dark.
  <LI>{Channell Wasson}
    There are ample options for touring luggage on a Brompton
    once one breaks the rigid mesmeric concepts of conventional panniers
  <LI>{Channell Wasson}
    I was in Mexico last week and rode 52 miles from airport
    in Baja to my house.  The Brompton was the greatest for this road trip I
    used touring bar ends and had my suitcase on the rack.  I had expanded
    the rack size with a light weight bbq grill bought at local hardware
    store.  Great solution.  Also used pannier.  My load was ample and the
    bike handled it well.
  <LI>{Phil Gough}
    I have never toured on a Brompton, there is no need as I also 
    have a Moulton AM7 for that purpose,  but a recent 13 mile fairly hilly 
    ride on my 5-speed nine years old T5 left me with a noticeable sense of 
    tired legs which the same ride on a big bike or the Moulton doesn't 
    cause.  I have a front mounted thermoplastic briefcase, which has big 
    frontal area, but at low speeds unless there is a headwind this is not a
     problem.  The lack of any front shock absorber when running on hard 
    (75psi) Raleigh Record tyres is in my experience the greatest single 
    factor in making the Brompton an unrealistic choice for loaded touring 
    on anything but flat and smooth terrain.  But I am over 50 and not as 
    resilient as once was.
  <LI>{Norman Tulloch}
    It is a brilliant design, folds quickly into a compact package (though not
    a very light one) and the front pannier is excellent.
    <BR>
    However, it is not particularly pleasant on roughish roads.  I live in a
    country area where the roads, though good, are not always billiard-table
    smooth.  The Brompton is fine on smooth surfaces: one can whir along quite
    happily and pleasantly, but as soon as one hits a less good surface, things
    change: the bike judders and stutters and rattles and generally becomes not
    much fun.  My large-wheeled traditional touring bike flows over the same
    surfaces in a relaxed, smooth, quiet and soothing way.  (One thing that
    does annoy me about the Brompton is its various rattles.  Bikes should be
    QUIET.)
  <LI>{Joerg Scheiner, Aug 1998}
    I don't know if you need to improve it. I mounted a pair of Biogrips to
    the handle bar to accomodate my hands position and installed a Brooks
    leather saddle from the mountain bike for more comfort. I use a T3 and
    didn't do a holiday on it but I took it with me on many trips and it
    carried all the luggage. In one case I did a weekend trip with the tent
    and sleeping bag and maitress on the rear rack and some cloths in the
    front bag (and the Alto =3D "Bratsche" in the backpack. I did 80 km on
    one day and felt comfortable with my three gears. I also could think of
    using a Rucksack for most of the luggage and fix it to the back rack and
    leave some heavy or important things for the front bag.
  <LI>{Nico J. de Boer, Aug 1998}
    We came back last week from a tour in north England (York, Scarborough).
    Our 'improvements' consisted of a T5 with the same front bag, a nylon
    "weekend bag" of ca. 50 liters on the rear rack, and a small backpack
    for photo gear. In total, we had ca. 16kg of luggage per person. This
    was an adequate solution for us, though we had to walk up the steeper
    hills. I don't know whether the first gears of a T3 and a T5 are much
    different, but if you insist on cycling uphill, you should consider a
    seriously smaller gear. 
  <LI>{Rob Cope, Aug 1998}
    I find the biggest problem with a Brompton medium/ long distance is the
    difficulty varying cycling position.  I can walk up steep hills, get more
    than enough luggage on the front block or in a Bike-Hod - but sore back,
    numb hands &amp; bum is no fun.  So I suggest;
    <BR>
    Find your favourite saddle &amp; fit it; even if it is heavy and expensive.
    I've currently got a Vetta(?) with 2 gel layers & twin springs, but still
    suspect I'll end up with a wide Brooks.  The Brompton throws all your weight
    on the saddle, so it has to be good?
    <BR>
    I have ended up with the Biogrips on by bars: horrible price (16-23GBP:
    cheaper in Germany) but near-indestructible and *no more numb hands*.
    Cyclecare keep em & IIRC Giant are also importing them.  I'd like to fit the
    neat mini bar-ends Avon Valley Cycles do, but have yet to work out they
    could coexist with the Biogrips.
    <BR>
    Brakes: I am lucky enough to have the original Sachs fitted which work OK
    once long Koolstop pads were substituted.  The Alhonga dual pivots look
    (from friends machines) to work well on the front but IMHO the backbolt &
    washers is not sufficient to take the greater braking force.
    <BR>
    Luggage: the Brompton positively thrives on front loads.  Do a Henshaw: buy
    a big cheap waterproof holdall then fit a mounting bracket (Custom Folder
    sell one) for the front block.  Details in the new A to B just out.  Make
    sure the bag does not stick far beyond the front axle, else the whole thing
    may pivot round that axle & spontaneously fold (not when you're aboard, I
    hasten to add).
    <BR>
    Gears: yes, get the lower gears but I find a gentle push up steep hills much
    more pleasant than straining at the same speed awheel.  You see so much more
    and the bike is still taking the load.
  <LI>{Alan Bennett, Jul 1999}
    This last weekend my yellow L-5, the "Killer Bee" and I took part in the
    7000 rider, 200 mile, annual Seattle to Portland ride. The two day event
    required riding 100 miles each day. I am happy to report the Brompton
    served me well and we rolled to the finish line late Sunday afternoon.
    <BR>
    Over the two days we averaged 12.8 mph. The course was somewhat hilly on
    the second day but there was the benefit of a tailwind the last thirty
    miles. Several roadies misidentified the bike as a Bike Friday. There
    were in fact, at least three Friday=92s on the ride, but as best I could
    determine a sole Brompton.  A fellow rider on seeing the Bee folded on
    Saturday night referred to it as a "salad spinner."
    <BR>
    Modifications to my L-5 are limited to the front derailleur, and V brake
    on the front wheel. Both modifications came from Channell. The tires
    were Primos. I had minimal training for the ride, though I do routinely
    commute the 14 mile round-trip to work by bike.
    <BR>
    I sustained minimal bodily injury. Sunday evening I nursed a full size
    Brompton based blister on my buttocks. It is with the comfort of a
    pillow that I am able to type this message of accomplishment. I now
    believe it would have been wise to heed the discussions on alternate
    saddles.
  <LI>{Jim McLaughlin, Nov 1999}
    I have done about 100 miles on my Brompton this week so far.  Now that I have
    converted into a recumbent "Brecki" [@recumbent_kit] I am losing interest in my full size bike
    entirely.  I hope to try a couple 100 mile rides on the Brecki before the year
    is out.
    <BR>
    I do have wider gears than stock.  I definitely recommend either the Mountain
    Drive or Channell's front derailleur [@GearingChange] if you plan to tow heavy loads or travel
    mountainous terrain.  The 5 speed is good enough for commuting.  I've pulled a
    trailer in the mountains with no trouble on camping trips.

# All terrain Brompton?
  <UL>
  <LI>{O'Reilly, Peter, Nov 1999}
    I just want to share my experience riding my L5 this past weekend as I was
    pleasantly surprised at how well the bike performed.  On Saturday I
    participated on an organized groupd ride which covered the perimeter of
    NYC's Manhattan island.  Before the ride, we were forewarned about riding on
    dirt roads, gravel, hopping onto sidewalks, etc.  Hopefully someday, the
    city will completely develop a full scale, well groomed bike/pedestrian path
    around the island as it contains so much potential for leisure use.
    <BR>
    Anyway, the ride turned out to be a mini cyclcross expedition as the route
    was very disjointed.  At many instances we would have to get off the bicycle
    and carry it over a guardrail, up a steep set of steps a sand/salt dune or
    some other obstacle.  The people I rode with had mountian bikes or very
    robust hybrid bikes.  It definitely was an advantage for me carrying the
    Brompton instead of one of the full sized bicycles.   Definitely not very
    technical, but modestly challenging and varried was the terrain we rode on
    from NYC smooth to pot hole laden pavement, loose fine gravel, dirt paths,
    paths covered with foliage to cobble stone roads.  I did not bother hopping
    any curbs as it was really not necessary nor would I want to do so with the
    B. (It's sharp handling and with ease manueverability makes it a trivial
    exercise when riding along deserted sidewalks to eventaully find the
    sidewalk ramp) That said, the bike handled remarkably well.  I felt very
    secure while riding the B over such terrain.  In particular, I was impressed
    at how much the rear suspension block dampened alot of road shock while
    riding over a stretch of cobble stone road.
    <BR>
    During the ride, I had witnessed some great river side sights and had
    attracted alot of attention (and possibly envy? from my fellow riders).
    While the group had stopped at one point to study a BMW being lifted out of
    the Hudson river - a Police department diver had came running over to ask me
    about the B.  It also was a nice spectacle to fold up the bike and take it
    into the donut shop for our groups rest stop while the other bikes remained
    unsecurely parked outside.

# Can you store a Brompton on a boat and not have it rust away?
  <UL>
  <LI>{Jerry Kaidor, May 1999}
    The Brompton's frame is mild steel, first galvanized (covered with zinc)
    and then powder-coated over the galvanizing. That's
    about as rust-resistant as a steel finish gets.  As long as you don't
    scratch the paint, the frame itself should be fine.  Of course, there's
    also the accessories, brakes, shifters, spokes, etc which would rust at
    whatever rate is normal for those.
    As far as rust is concerned:  The frame is mild steel.  This is
    galvanized, and then powder-coated over the galvanizing.  That's about
    as good as you get with steel.  I don't know about the fittings, bolts etc
    though.
  <LI>{Nico J. de Boer, May 1999}
    And don't be too optimistic about that rate in corrosive environments:
    my "dynamo rear rack stay" is very flecky indeed, the pump rusts inside,
    the wheel axis bolts tend to get corroded as well, and inside the chain
    guide wheel axes some rust may develop. The "folding axis" of the folding
    pedal doesn't look too shiny, the spokes tend to rust a little, and the
    saddle clamp bolt is a bit orange too. You can say I should polish those
    parts more often...
    Could it be that all this corrosion arises from the contact of different
    metals?
  <LI>{Arnie G., Apr 1999}
    [ Could you put the whole bike in a plastic bag with a dehumidifier to prevent
    rust? ]
    I actually thought of that idea - not too sure how practical it is on a boat,
    but they sell packets of dehumidifying chemicals for small boat stuff -
    silica gel I think.  It would have to be a hell of a good seal and I would
    have to refresh it often, but it's a possibility.
  <LI>{JayG555, May 1999}
    I've found that spraying a fine coat of WD-40 oil on all bike surfaces and
    then wiping off excess is a good rust preventative and one that is used by
    friends of mine who carry bikes on board. Jay G.

# Reasons not to buy a Brompton
  <UL>
  <LI>{Tom Bennett, Aug 1999}
    Drawbacks of the Brompton:  First, the weight.  Although it doesn't seem
    heavy at first, try carrying the Brompton any distance, and you will realize
    that it is not a task done for amusement.  The little wheels are pathetic for
    rolling any more than a few feet at a time.  Interestingly enough, the wheels
    never smashed into my ankle bones after the first day or two of riding.  I
    guess there's nothing like excruciating, agonizing pain to divert you from a
    bad habit.   The brakes are pretty pathetic, but I got used to them, more or
    less.  They slow you down, anyway.  The one hassle is that you can't really
    feel totally free zooming down hills, because you know that you'll need about
    a mile to stop.  I rationalize this by realizing that it is good training in
    case I ever decide to become a locomotive engineer.
  </UL>
  <P>
  As one might expect, most contributers on Brompton-Talk are using their Brompton,
  so they consider it at the very least useful. Really disappointed customers won't
  spend more time and money complaining on a mailing list that the manufacturer
  isn't even reading. Still here's a summary of problems that came up, in my personal
  order of importance:
  <UL>
  <LI>Broken handlebars:
   as on many bicycles, the handlebars are made of Aluminium to
   reduce weight.
   On oversized mountainbikes, Aluminium may last forever,
   but on the Brompton the 2mm thick tubing isn't up to rough daily use.
   For the gory details, read @BrokenHandlebar.
  <LI>Handlebar tuning:
   The peculiar Brompton steering column doesn't allow any adjustment.
   the handlebars fixed into this column can easily be exchanged for ordinary
   bicycle handlebars, but these would end up particularly low,
   unsuitable for the tall or anyone enjoying an upright riding position.
   On the other hand, some people find the standard handlebars to high.  More in @alt_handlebars.
  <LI>Brakes:
   some are disappointed by the standard brakes fitted until March 2000,
   particularly when it's wet (see @BrakeOpinions).
   More importantly, some ruin their rear rim after less than a year of daily use.
   Like the handlebars, this is a common problem in bicycles these days:
   hard brake blocks pick up grit and grind the soft aluminium (again!) rims away.
   For some year, the Brompton - as other bicycles - came with anodized rims (aluminium
   with a hard coating).  But as soon as the brake blocks pick up parts of the anodizing,
   they grind the rest of the rim away faster than if the "protection" hadn't been there.
   On a Brompton the rims are only half as long as on big wheels, so the
   problem shows up earlier.
   <BR>
   However both problems can be resolved either by:
	<UL>
 	<LI>(very) regular cleaning of the brake blocks, as the manual faintly points prescribes
	<LI>replacing the brake blocks with high quality, softer material (see @AltBrakeBlocks)
	</UL>
  </UL>

# Brompton service
  I live in Belgium, close to the UK but for the bit of water in between.
  My Brompton has been in service three times.
  The first time it took four months to repair a broken rim
  (cause and lessons learnt: see @cracked_rim).
  According to the bike shop, most of the delay was due to Brompton shipping the part.
  The second time it took three months to replace a broken frame (some time after it crashed into a car).  Same excuse.
  The third time it took nine months to replace a frame (alledgedly due to improper use by me).
  <BR>
  On the other hand, service inside the UK is reported to be quite good:
  <UL>
  <LI>{Peter Amey, Jul 1998}
    Quick update on the broken front frame tube I reported a couple of weeks 
    back.  
    <BR>
    Brompton have replaced the frame component under warranty including 
    covering all transport costs to return the machine.  Turn round time was 1 
    week.  While they had it they have changed a few other things, such as a 
    worn saddle, and replaced/serviced the rear pivot bearings.  I was told 
    this was "compensation for the inconvenience" of being without the 
    machine for a week (I had forgotten just how cumbersome cumbersomes are!).
    Overall quite impressive service.
  <LI>{David Cox, Jun 2000}
    Replacing the rear mudguard (fender) on my Brompton L3 has become something
    of a marathon.  After six years hard use the guard cracked after a
    transatlantic flight, nearly a year later and after another trip it split
    and was held together for 3 months with duct tape but it finally gave up on
    the Waendel ride in Wellingborough.
    <BR>
    I'd ordered a new mudguard via my local dealer but it arrived 3 weeks later
    as a basic guard with no stays, I then ordered the stays which arrived after
    another 2 weeks. However, I couldn't fit it last night because all of the
    fittings are either ground down by constant folding or rusted in.  I now
    need to order every specific bolt and plate it appears. When I buy Esge/SKS
    guards for my other bikes (infrequently they also last years) they come with
    the fittings and go straight on !
    <BR>
    No doubt Brompton are trying to save us money but six year old fittings cant
    be recycled; so if you need to replace your mudguard make sure that you
    order every last nut, plate, bolt and screw or like me you'll have half a
    C-type and a wet bum.  Not ideal for commuting in June in UK.
  </UL>

#AndrasToth.html Case Study by Andras Toth, March 1998
  I have had my Brompton for more than 4 months now and have been subscribed
  to the mailing list since January. I find it is a good forum for discussing
  Brompton-related technical issues, but I personally lack the user aspect of
  it.  I think it is best to admit right at the start that even changing the
  tyre on the back wheel of my bicycle is a considerable challenge to me, and
  I presume it must be the case for the silent majority of urban cyclists.
  However, this does not prevent me from doing everyday cycling and being
  committed to the propagation of alternative means of transport.
  It is my belief that Brompton is truly a revolution in the concept of the
  bicycle. In comparison to its importance, the ways in which it could modify
  our society's travelling behaviours does not get enough attention on this
  forum.
  That is why I have decided to make public a detailed description of my
  usage of Brompton. This case study was originally compiled for a friend
  interested in new means of personal transportation who did not know
  Brompton. It certainly repeats a lot of information that you already know.
  What I would like to do is to incite reactions on the way I am using my
  Brompton, especially in the second part of my study.
  I will publish it in two parts in order to reduce the amount of eventual
  responses flowing in at the same time.
  Here is the complete table of contents of my study.

  0. Introduction
  </H4>
  The following analysis will be based on the everyday use of a Brompton L3
  bicycle (complete foldability, 3 gears, no initial light or carrier system)
  in Paris. That is, it takes into account the current position of foldable
  bicycles in society and on the market (their available features, their
  uniqueness, their price etc) . By no means is this an analysis of the
  potential role that these types of bicycles could play if they are ever
  manufactured in massive quantities and become wide-spread in a community.
  <H4>
  1. How I bought it
  </H4>
  I saw the first Brompton in my life at the Annual General Meeting of the
  European Cyclists' Federation in Vienna in 1994. This remained the only
  context where I kept meeting them in the following years, until I bought my
  own. I have never seen one in the street or heard or seen any kind of
  advertisement for it (in Brussels, Budapest, Paris).  It seems the Brompton
  firm for some reason does not intend to break through with their models on
  the international market, they are satisfied with keeping the Brompton in
  the class of expensive elite bicycles accessible only to a relatively
  wealthy public.
  There were three factors that made me buy a Brompton on 9th November 1997:
  previous direct experience with it, a concrete problem that only a foldable
  bike could solve, and the favorable conditions of its purchase.
  <H5>
  1.1. Previous direct experience
  </H5>
  In 1995 I had the occasion to try a five speed model in Brussels, in a
  hilly urban context for a few hours. Without the extremely satisfactory
  results of this probe I would have never seriously considered buying one.
  It may be one of the drawbacks with expensive bicycles that people do not
  usually get to ride them on longer distances before they make the decision
  of buying them or not. The ultimate convincing power is real-life experience.
  <H5>
  1.2. A concrete need
  </H5>
  Even with this, the Brompton would have remained one of my numerous dreams
  in life if I had not moved to Paris in October 1997 on a nine-month
  scholarship. What pushed me into considering the purchase of a Brompton was
  a concrete objective need. I had sworn to myself that I would use a bicycle
  in Paris just as I do in Budapest and as I did in Brussels on another
  scholarship. However, it turned out that my accommodation was near one the
  southern gates of inner Paris and my university 5 kilometers north from the
  northern edge of the town, in Saint-Denis. On a normal bike I would have
  had to cover 30 kilometers every day, crossing the very center of Paris and
  going on highways in a sea of cars. The only way to achieve daily commuting
  by bicycle and also to shorten the one hour trip to 35-40 minutes was to
  take the bicycle in the suburban underground train (RER) that crossed the
  center of Paris. The only bicycle with which I could do this was the Brompton.
  <H5>
  1.3. A favorable deal
  </H5>
  A third factor, the proximity of Great Britain also played an important
  role. In France, the model I bought costs 4700 franks (approx. 780 USD). In
  Britain, 391 GBP (approx. 610 USD). A difference of about 1000 French
  franks! Fortunately, a friend living in London just happened to jump over
  to Paris and he was kind enough to buy the bike for me there and bring it
  with him. The knowledge that prices are so much lower in Britain might
  convince people that it is not worth buying a Brompton from the resellers
  in their country. On the other hand, getting a Brompton from Britain is not
  always as convenient as in my case.
  <BR>
  What should be remembered from all this is that an average person is not
  likely to have any of my motivating factors to buy a foldable bicycle.
  <H4>
  2. The features of the Brompton
  </H4>
  <H5>
  2.1. Unfolded mode
  </H5>
  There is little danger of being wrong if I say that unfolded, the Brompton
  works as any other city bicycle. The joints are solid and with the
  three-gear system I can move around as easily and quickly (even on slopes)
  as on a traditional bicycle. The lack of an original lighting system is
  rapidly compensated with removable back and front lights that I take off
  when I fold the bicycle. The main difference is in stability, due to the
  small diameter of the wheels, but I am not sure whether it is a drawback or
  an advantage. Although at first it was weird that the bicycle responded to
  the slightest move of my hands on the handlebars, I never feel unsecure,
  even when I am descending from a hill at full speed. On the other hand, the
  size of the wheels makes it much easier to navigate between cars trapped in
  a traffic jam or other obstacles that require intensive steering.
  What is clearly a disadvantage is the extreme sensibility of the bicycle to
  the unevenness of the road surface. It is virtually impossible to ride on a
  paved road, and even relatively smooth surfaces that you do not even notice
  on a normal bike are unpleasant for a Brompton user. However, occasional
  bumps are not a problem (even fun to take), because the bicycle has
  excellent suspension thanks to the rubber bumper at the meeting point of
  the rear wheel assembly and the rest of the bicycle.
  The other thing that I find uncomfortable is the way the rear wheel
  assembly flaps back when I lift the bicycle by the handlebar and the seat
  pillar. The manual says I should not bother about it, just let it hang and
  bump into everything, but I do find it a nuisance when I have to lift the
  unfolded bicycle on stairs. So what I do is that I grab the back by the
  rear wheel assembly instead of the seat pillar, which requires a little
  more bending and effort from me, but keeps the bicycle together.
  The positive aspect of this feature is that parking the Brompton by
  swinging the rear wheel assembly under the bicycle is even easier than
  parking a normal bike.
  I have not been to a longer trip with the Brompton yet, but I have the
  feeling I could easily do 50 kilometers on it at one go. One Sunday
  afternoon and evening I did about 30 kilometers, with several
  interruptions, but in very hilly areas of Paris. I felt tired sometimes
  during but not after the trip. In the last section, on my way home at 11.30
  pm I even raced a little on the empty avenues, attaining a speed of 40-50
  km/h.
  <H5>
  2.2. Folding/Unfolding
  </H5>
  The average time for these actions is 17-18 seconds in my practice, not
  counting the mounting and dismounting of the front light in the dark (the
  back light is constantly on the seat pillar just under the seat).
  <H5>
  2.3. Folded mode
  </H5>
  The Brompton is closest of all existing bicycles to the concept of
  portability, but it is not a portable bicycle. A little smaller and 5
  kilogramms lighter, it would be one. But at 11 kilogramms and at the size
  of a small suitcase, it is only suited to be carried on small distances and
  in uncrowded public spaces. At 5 pm, I do not even attempt to take the
  subway with it, I know I would not be able to get on the train with
  something so big in my hands. In folded mode the bicycle can be pulled by
  the unfolded handlebar on its miniature plastic wheels. I rarely use this
  function, because it is useful only in very specific conditions: when the
  distance is too long to carry the bicycle in your hands but too short to
  unfold it, and you know that you would have to unfold and fold it several
  times. Also it is quite uncomfortable for someone of my height (178
  centimeters) to drag it this way, I have to lift the front a bit and thus
  the bicycle easily looses its equilibrium. Not to mention that these mini
  wheels are even more sensitive to the unevenness of the ground, you can
  only use them on completely smooth surfaces.
  So most of the time I just grab the folded bicycle by its saddle and carry
  it as a suitcase. I switch hands every hundred meters approximately so that
  I avoid feeling tired in my arms too quickly.
  Unless the frame of the bicycle is dirty too, you will not get stained
  carrying the Brompton. What the brochure says is true: the chain is inside
  the folded frame and does not get in contact with you or other people
  standing beside you.
  The only extra piece that I would readily buy for my bicycle is the folding
  left pedal. In folded mode, this is the only part of the bicycle that
  sticks out from the otherwise compact assembly, and it bumps into
  everything when I carry it.
  <P>
  In reply to some negative comments received concerning the publication of
  my study on this list, just two remarks:
    <UL>
      <LI>Obviously my intention is not to convince you about the utility of the
  Brompton. I just wanted to compare my experience with others'. I thought
  that everybody out there would be able to disregard the original intention
  of the study, but apparently it is too difficult for some.
      <LI>There is a nice button in most mailreaders called 'Trash' or 'Delete'. If
  you do not want to read the rest, it is up to you to press it. When I do
  it, I generally do not announce it to all the members of the list. If the
  message is too big and causes disturbance like in the case of the picture
  posted a few weeks ago, of course we have to discuss it, but I believe my
  study does not occupy enough space on your mail servers to cause major
  inconvenience.
    </UL>
  <BR>
  Having stated that, here is the second part of the study (chapter 3-5),
  dealing more specifically with my strategy to use the Brompton in Paris.
  I would really like to hear your comments about how *you* handle the
  situations described below. Consider my text as a series of questions
  rather than statements.
  <H4>
  3. Using the Brompton
  </H4>
  <H5>
  3.1. Cycling strategy
  </H5>
  The main advantage of the ideal portable bicycle is that you can switch
  from cycling to another mode of transport at any point in your trip.
  Possible reasons include big traffic, bad weather, exhaustion or illness,
  distance, flat tyre. However, as every urban cyclist knows it, if the
  distance is inferior to five kilometers the most convenient means of
  transport remains the bicycle. So in approximately 50% of all my trips in
  Paris I use exclusively the bicycle in its unfolded mode (the city center
  is about 5 kilometers from my place). If I have the time or feel like doing
  it, I even cover larger distances.
  A Brompton owner must always start his or her day by making up the
  itinerary to be covered during the day and considering whether to take the
  bicycle or not. Rain is not a decisive factor unless the weather forecast
  predicted it for the entire day. You can always carry the Brompton on the
  way to work in the morning rain and ride on it on the way back in the
  evening sun. What determines the need for the Brompton is the proportion of
  the distance to be covered by foot and the distance feasible on your bike.
  It does not make much sense to carry the bike in your hand for a total of
  one hour if you only use it for five minutes on the way from home to the
  subway station in the morning and back in the evening.
  Some might think that these arguments are useless since you do not spend so
  much time carrying your bicycle. If you know there is a longer distance
  ahead, you just unfold it and ride! Unfortunately, this is true only in
  ideal circumstances. If you do not have to stop anywhere and there is a
  direct exit from the subway where you get off, you do not have to carry the
  bike very far. But as soon as you want to do some shopping, especially
  going from one shop to the other, or meet friends in the street and want to
  go along with them to caf&eacute;s, bookshops etc., you are facing a dilemma:
  should I leave my bicycle unfolded and attached to a rack outside, or
  should I fold it and take it inside? Once I have it folded, should I unfold
  it until I get to the next shop? Usually you will end up carrying the
  bicycle with you, since the Brompton is too expensive to be left outside,
  and anyway, why did you buy a foldable bicycle if you have to lock it to
  racks? As for unfolding and folding it every time, fast as it may be, it is
  nonetheless annoying if done so frequently. So if during the day you plan
  to do area-limited activities with frequent movement like shopping you
  better leave your Brompton at home or in a safe place.
  In Paris, there is an additional factor that makes the combined use of
  public transport and of the Brompton difficult. The car-centered concept of
  urbanism that has been prevailing in this century sent the vast majority of
  public transport underground. The subway system in Paris is perhaps the
  most complex one in the world, with 13 subway lines and 4 underground
  suburban trains converging in numerous points in the area delimited by the
  peripheral highway. Ch&acirc;telet-les-Halles in the city center is the biggest
  of all stations, three of the four suburban trains and the most important
  subway lines cross here in what we may safely call an underground city with
  a cultural and shopping center. In an area of approximately one square
  kilometer all subway stations are linked by underground pedestrian
  passages. If you get off your subway or train in this maze, it may well
  take 10 to 15 minutes and several hundred meters before you see the sky
  above your head. Needless to say, cycling and skating are forbidden in
  these passages, where you often have to first go down in order to reach the
  surface, taking stairs and escalators several times. And this is just one
  of the dozen of places in the Parisian subway system where converging
  subway lines create underground pedestrian labyrinths. To worsen the
  situation, the automatic checkpoints for tickets are built in a way that
  anybody carrying something larger than a handbag will find himself or
  herself in trouble. The passages between the machines are way too narrow,
  and sometimes you even have to cross several checkpoints when changing from
  one line to the other. Using the subway system when arriving in Paris with
  heavy luggage is a real nightmare. It is not much better having a Brompton
  in your hands.
  If a town is ever constrained to have recourse to the subway in order to
  facilitate surface traffic (which is already something not recommended by
  modern urban transport theories), at least they should make sure that from
  any point in the stations there is a direct and easy access to the surface.
  This is not only in the interest of travellers with luggage and Brompton
  users, but also to ensure the general conviviality of life in that town.
  The best way to deal with the situation in the current circumstances is to
  acquire a good knowledge of the main stations and spot the nearest and
  shortest exit to the surface, regardless of your destination. Once you are
  on your unfolded bike things are much easier.
  <H5>
  3.2. Parking strategy
  </H5>
  You do not park a Brompton the way you do it with normal bicycles. Ideally
  you always have it with you, since there are two good reasons that prevent
  you from leaving it somewhere outside attached to a bicycle rack. It is too
  valuable and it does not seem logical: having paid for a foldable bike, you
  would be crazy not to profitate from its special features. So in you go
  with it.
  However, depending on the place where you have entered, it is sometimes
  advisable to get rid of the bicycle inside. If you are in a cinema, concert
  hall, theater, or even a restaurant, it is very likely that there will be a
  cloakroom where they will be more than delighted to take care of a unique
  foldable bicycle, a colorful spot in the eternal flow of coats and bags.
  Chances are that even if there is no cloakroom, the employees of the
  establishment will help you find a safe place to put your Brompton. If you
  think the place is not safe enough, you can attach it to some tube or
  stable piece of furniture with the chain you always carry in your bag. The
  same thing can be done at your workplace.
  If you meet negative reactions, do not insist. Just walk out of sight and
  attach your bicycle in a discreet place in the building, or ultimately take
  it with you and put it by the wall near your seat so that you can keep an
  eye on it. This has happened to me only two or three times in one and a
  half months. However, things have never gone as far as being explicitly
  told to leave the bicycle in the street.
  In supermarkets, it is a good idea to put the Brompton in your handcart and
  push it around as if it was a child, provided you do not have to buy too
  many things.
  In cantines, you will quickly learn how to hold your tray with all the
  dishes in one hand and carry the Brompton in the other.
  <H5>
   3.3. Public response
  </H5>
  This is the most difficult thing a new Brompton user has to get used to. No
  matter in which position your bicycle is, folded, unfolded, or in-between,
  it will always sollicitate the curious eyes and the remarks of bypassers.
  In average I am stopped two times a day in the street or elsewhere by
  people asking questions and admiring the bicycle. The two most frequent
  remarks are 'It's practical, isn't?' and 'This is a folding bicycle!', as
  if I was unaware of it. In the long run it is rather irritating. Some
  people ask further questions, which concern mostly the weight and the price
  of the bicycle, where it is sold, and also how safe and efficient it is to
  ride on it. The conversation is usually interrupted when I say the price of
  the bicycle. It is really THE discourageing factor for everybody.
  As I have been involved in the work of different urban cyclist and
  environmental associations, I am sensible to the fact that people who see
  me use this bicycle automatically start thinking about transport issues in
  their town, so I consider it as a good pedagogical tool.
  <H5>
  4. Comparison of the advantages of the Brompton and a normal city bicycle
  </H5>
  Advantages of the Brompton
  <UL>
  <LI>it does not get stolen since it is always with you
  <LI>it is easy to store it at home or at work (ideal for appartments in
  blocks of flats)
  <LI>as a cyclist:
      at any time you can switch from cycling to another mode of transport if
      the weather turns bad, you are tired or you do not feel well, you have a
      flat tyre, suddenly you have to go very far, the traffic becomes too dense
      etc.
  <LI>as a public transport user:
	  you can reduce walking times (to the station etc.)
  <LI>it can be easily transported from one town to the other or on holidays by
  plane, by car or by train
  <LI>it helps raise public awareness of transport issues
  <LI>it is easy to navigate between cars in a traffic jam because the wheels
  are small
  </UL>
  <BR>
  Advantages of a normal city bike
  (=disadvantages of the Brompton)
  <UL>
  <LI>less expensive
  <LI>since it is less expensive, you are not so worried about it and you can
  leave it in a bicycle rack when doing shopping or meeting friends who do
  not have a bicycle etc.
  <LI>people do not bother you with silly questions when you use it
  <LI>it may have more gears and may be more comfortable and faster (but not
  necessarily)
  <LI>you can carry a second person if necessary
  <LI>it is less sensitive to the unevenness of the road surface
  <LI>the rear wheel does not hang loose when you lift the bicycle
  <LI>it is easier and less expensive to maintain and repair (spare parts etc.)
  </UL>
  <H4>
   5. A glimpse into the future
  </H4>
  I realize that some of the features described above are closely related to
  the premise that my Brompton is the only one around. If ever the novelty of
  the bicycle is gone and more and more people start to use it, we will have
  to rethink the whole issue again.
  I try to imagine what it would be like if everybody had a Brompton-like
  bicycle.
  <UL>
  <LI>special guarded or lockable storing places would have to be set up inside
  the public institutions
  <LI>public transport vehicles would have to be redesigned to accommodate both
  the passengers and their 'luggage'
  <LI>of course, the requests of the present-day urban cyclist associations
  would have to be fulfilled all the same (bicycle infrastucture and
  restrictions on car use).
  </UL>
  So it is not such a big investment. The major part of the change is to
  happen in the portable bicycle manufacturers' attitude and in the habits of
  people.
