    Touring bag: the pockets at back are coming unstitched at the top and on
    one side it has torn the fabric. Anyone else experience similar fault. I
    certainly havenot abused siad bag - again only used a few times. Having

    90 PSI is about 6.2 bar, but beware of petrol station air pumps; pressure indicators may not function properly; carry a decent pressure gauge.
    I suppose your B. doesn't have the Raleigh Record tyres, because 90 PSI will be too much for them. I never go beyond 70-75 PSI.
  <LI>{Mike, Jul 2000}
    I'd find it hard to believe that any cyclist's pressure gauges are any
    better than ones at petrol stations. In the UK, Trading Standards not only
    check petrol pumps for delivering to specification but also forecourt air
    gauges. I'm not sure of the tolerance on the air gauges as far as Trading
    Standards go, but I bet it'll be nearer than you think. Check with the local
    TS - and if you find a gauge you think to be in error at a garage, report it
    to TS, they will go and check it and probably report back to you if you want
    them to. That also costs nothing - just another Council Tax service !
  <LI>{Mindak Dietmar, Jul 2000}
    Yes, but...
    When I was living in the UK I found that petrol station air pumps
    deliver only about 60 psi. Some kind of 'pressure limiter' comes in to
    prevent motorists causing spectacular explosions on the forecourt. It's
    a safety feature for car drivers that read their manual upside down. You
    only find that out *after* you've paid 10p for using the pump.

    And this is true too often in the States.  Rarely -- even in a bike shop --
    does it get over 80 psi.  In an emergency, its worth a bet of $0.25 to see
    how high it will pump.  After that, its the "hand-held", then home.

  <LI>{Ka Lun Tam, Jul 2000}
    I own a Brompton T5, purchased before Christmas so this is not the
    newest model.  Instead, it's the older model with the not-so-good brakes,
    but the brakes work fine for me for what I need.
    <BR>
    These brakes, however, are set up so that the brake cable enters from
    the bottom and not from the top.  When I tighten the brakes by turning the
    adjustment screw by the calipers, I notice that after a while the adjustment
    screw screws back in to the calipers on its own and loosens the brakes again.
    There's that little nut on the adustment screw that I turn, and I position
    the nut so it's right up against the caliper arm, theoretically stopping
    the adjustment screw from turning.  However, the nut is loose and gravity (and
    vibrations) allow the nut to turn and fall out of the way, allowing the
    adjustment screw to screw itself back into the caliper arm, thus loosening
    the brakes.
    <BR>
    (Do I make any sense here?)
    <BR>
    Has anyone else had this problem?  Is there an easy way to keep my
    brake calipers adjusted to the proper tension?  To keep that nut from falling?
    To keep the adjustment screw from turning?
  <LI>{Mike, Jul 2000}
    You're doing the right thing, just not getting the locknut tight enough IMO.

  <LI>{Stein Somers, Aug 2000}
    Channell spoke of "thread separation" in an early batch of Schwalbes; my
    bike shop warned about the (same?) problem when I bought my pair.  One
    would be forewarned by a bulge developing tens of miles before things
    get dangerous.  You can exchange them without charge, but obviously it's
    quite inconvenient to have to do so.  It didn't happen to me; it sure
    happened to someone who's letter is printed in the latest A to B. But
    I'm puzzled about Chris's story and the remark in the "Map of London"
    item in A to B.  Are they thread separation victims or does the Schwalbe
    really wear quickly?




  <LI>{Jim McLaughlin, Aug 2000}
    Actually one can develop more power at higher speeds, but slipping off
    the pedals is a problem.  When I have cleats on my pedals I often exceed
    100 rpm climbing hills on my recumbent if I'm trying to go quickly.  I
    believe you'll find that professional racers tend to stay above 80 rpm
    most of the time, except when they run out of low enough gears.  Then
    they stand up.
    <BR>
    It does take a while to build up to those cadences, but there are real
    advantages for the cartilage in one's knees.  I have several friends who
    quit riding due to knee problems, but have succeeded in returning to
    biking by staying above 80 rpm.
    <BR>
    I suspect this is why there is so much interest in lower gears for the
    Brompton.  But there are other reasons: I just biked 12 miles along a
    hilly route with 153 pounds of groceries from my buying club in the
    trailer.  I would have liked even lower gears for that.
  <LI>{Mike Paley in Millom, Aug 2000}
    I've always been built like a weight-lifter and not a sprinter. I'm sure
    things have seriously improved since I started aerobics about 4 years ago.
    Before I can pedal like buggery, I've got to get the heart to withstand it,
    the lungs/diaphragm to cope and all the furry bits in between. I daresay I'm
    doing a lot better now than I was.
    <BR>
    Secondly, I cycle for pleasure, not to race. I don't do many miles in a day,
    a few here, a few there. Had I been looking at >50 miles per day, it would
    be a different bike, feet attached to pedals and likely the higher cadences.
    As it's not, the gearing on the standard T5 is fine for me although 5th
    could do with being higher. It's maybe why the "wide" gearing is fine for me
    and not for the fast pedallers. For them, it makes a big jump between
    ratios. After a tiring climb, I'll pedal in a lower gear and fast while I
    get my breath back.

    Because its rear is suspended, (and the handle bar flexes), it is more
    comfortable than some MTBs.  I've taken it on canal paths, gravel-ly roads
    and other types OK.  Of course the 16" wheels don't take potholes well.  And
    they get bogged down in anything (dirt, gravel, sand) deep or loose.  But any
    fairly firm, smooth surface shouldn't pose a problem (unlike, say,

    Off road the bike is overtly dangerous when any surface into which
    the front wheel can suddenly sink or on a slippery surface - it will
    throw you over the handlebars or slide you straight off as the tyres
    are too narrow & too hard to cope with these conditions. In the
    second case it is hopeless in ice & sloshy snow & slippery wet road
    surfaces such as cobbles & on metal inspection covers.
    <BR>
    You will get the tyres cut to shreds & spend life repairing punctures
    on gravel chip paths/tracks. If, as Sustrans recommend councils,
    crushed limestone is used that is fine. It compacts & drains well and
    does not have sharp edges on any size chip. Therefore you need to
    know your track before you cycle it - defeats the object tho'!.

Subject: Punctures
  <LI>{Jeff Dauvin, Sep 2000}
    I brought this up sometime a go but never got much feedback.
    <BR>
    How do people deal with punctures?
    <BR>
    I sometimes get the impression that most respondents on this list
    accept them as fact of life - I cannot - I don't expect to get any
    punctures in my car tyres in a 30-40Kmile life - why should I settle
    for less on my bike?
    <BR>
    Does Kevlar tape or belted wheels PREVENT punctures? If not why pay
    the extra cost?
    <BR>
    Does anyone use slime? Is it any good?
    <BR>
    I have resported to plastic tape, which over a period of time, but
    much less infrequently than penetrations, either rubs through the
    tube longtitutinally or across the join depending on the make. To
    prevent this I fillet old tubes & wrap them around the new tube
    before inserting it into the tyre - this is very bulky & needs talc
    or french chalk between them.
    <BR>
    What are other peoples views or solutions or are my expectations of
    cycling as a reliable mode of transport too high?

    My experience is that bike-commuting is like that.  I've even gotten
    punctures right next to my 'Mr Tuffy' tape on one bike.  Am trying to keep a

    Give slippery surfaces the respect they deserve. Don't use Brompton's
    own-brand tyres, they're seriously gripless on wet surfaces - and I'd
    include normal road surfaces in the range.

    Probably not significantly, but obviously worse than larger diameter wheels
    which climb out of the ruts they create with greater ease. I did find it
    hard work pedalling across a mown grass field, but far from impossible. I've
    been through off-road muddy puddles with mine - the main thing is to keep
    going, so a little momentum before hitting the soft stuff is very useful.

    I've not had a problem with cobblestones, although the ones I've ridden over
    are possibly "setts" i.e. flat-ish topped ones.

    Andrew Henry's dead right about this with his 4 rules. I do about 7 miles a

    I've not had a flat for as long as I can remember, at least a year.

    Pump them up hard, get a track pump, mine cost 20 GBP. Especially the back
    as it carries more weight. Helps to avoid pinch punctures and I'm sure makes
    it harder for sharp objects to penetrate.

    I regard any puncture repair as temporary and replace the tube asap.

    Watch where you ride, avoid potholes and other bumps with sharp edges and

    When I bought the Primos, the LBS sold me some very skinny tubes which
    flatted 3 times in the first week. Replaced them with some a lot thicker
    (and heavier), only 1 puncture since - about 2 years. Fit them very
    carefully, make sure there's no dirt or grit inside the tyre cover and try
    to do it without using levers.

    Totally agree that it's very important for the solution to dry properly
    before applying the patch. Rushing patching is a waste of time and if you're
    out in the wet, you tend to rush things ! Indoors, not only is it easier to
    make a clean surface, the warmth helps the solution to dry - and why not
    make a coffee and drink it while waiting !

    <BR>
    I've not done a roadside repair. My "recent" punctures have either been
    walking ditance from home or the bike shop ! I've only had one puncture
    miles from anywhere. There was me and my racer - no tools or anything ! I
    walked/wheeled the bike a few miles to a main road. I waited for no cars,
    then threw the bike over a wall. I then walked along the road towards home,
    and got a lift from someone I knew. I then took my van back for the bike.
    <BR>
    I've never felt that desperate to carry repair equipment, although I do
    sometimes now. I guess I'd favour a spare tube rather than roadside puncture
    repairs - for all the obvious reasons.

    I can't remember a flat in the last 6000 miles or so, but I ride mostly
    rural and always with liners or kevlar.  I also would like to see bikes
    as reliable as cars, but keep in mind the trade off between rolling
    resistance and puncture resistance.   You can afford to waste a lot more
    power pushing fat inefficient tires with a gas engine than you can
    afford with your legs and heart, so bike tires tend to be thinner

    Well said. I feel that people accepting high failure rates on bikes is
    what has kept reliability down. I have to take a spanner to my bike far
    more often than my car. And on my car I have details of torque settings
    for every bolt. Local bike shop laughed at me when I asked if there was
    a Brompton manual with torque settings!  But Brompton themselves must
    specify torques to the manufacturers.

    Anyway, I recently switches from Primos to Brompton Kevlars. No
    punctures yet, but it's only been three weeks.

    Depends what one is doing. On a leisure ride a puncture is a way of
    relieving the monotony of riding along with nothing to achieve:-)
    More seriously it's not too much of a problem, just part of an
    enjoyable day.
    <BR>
    On a business ride a puncture is more of a nuisance. One way of
    avoiding them is to avoid the sort of cycle ghettos councils like to
    provide. This also avoids the spreading of leaf mulch onto one's
    shoes.
    <BR>
    Solutions to business punctures, catch a train, bus or taxi and sort
    it out later. Take another vehicle that day. Take the thing to a shop
    and get them to fix it. Disposable plastic gloves. Spare tube.
    <BR>
    As others have pointed out it's possible to reduce cycle punctures to
    zero, at the cost of much harder work. There are "solid" tyres, like
    those fitted to some models of the Bike Hod. It's a matter of
    compromise.
    <BR>
    > Does anyone use slime? Is it any good?
    <BR>
    It's useful with the right tyres. It needs a fair amount in the tube
    to be most effective. This will damage the side wall of thin walled
    tyres like the Primo over time due to bumps. Raleigh Records work
    fine with it, no idea about the newer tyres. After a serious burst
    the tube needs to be retired for a while for the goo to dry fully
    before it can be repaired.

    Interesting!  I got my Brompton 2nd hand and maybe missed out on a few

    BTW The torque for the bolt that holds on the chain tensioner is 5nm!
    No wonder I broke it. :-(  My torque wrench doesn't go this low - that

    Unless I am mistaken, the Brompton was conceived in Cambridge.
    The only time in six years that I have ever had to pay for taking my bike on
    public transport was in Cambridge, when travelling to Stansted.
    Other bags going into the hold of the bus were bigger than mine but the
    conductor, seeing the wheels of the Brompton, insisted I pay an extra five
    pounds. I was already paying - I believe - eleven pounds for myself.
    There's now a train service to Stansted from Cambridge.

    As has been said the settings are in the manual, which comes with new
    Bromptons (or at least did and I guess this hasn't changed). The

    "With the backing of a few friends, Andrew turned his bedroom into a
    workshop and began the painstaking task of building prototypes. A
    flat in central London, however spacious, was hardly the ideal place
    to design and build a bicycle, but the congested streets below, and
    the narrow stairway into the flat, provided the necessary impetus to
    drive down the size of the folded package. The locality helped in
    other ways too. A mile to the east or west, and the new bicycle might
    have been known as the Kensington, the Belgravia, or even the
    Pimlico, but living above the Brompton Road, a stone's throw from the
    Brompton Oratory, the designer settled on Brompton."

Subject: Re: Punctures
  <LI>{Bob Gelman, Sep 2000}
        I carry both a spare tube and a patch kit together (I know I will NEVER
    find an 18" presta tube for my Birdy on the road).  When flat, I use the
    spare tube.  The patch kit would serve for serial punctures (it does happen
    ;)  ).  I've cut a small rectangle from a (free) Federal Express Tyvek
    mailing envelope for tyre cut reinforcement (a tyre "boot" I think it's
    called).  The stuff is as strong as Kevlar.   I also carry a $20 bill for a
    taxi cab emergency.  I've gotten a few rides from people and never needed
    the taxi money.  I suppose the folded Birdy looks like I've been in some
    sort of horrible accident (perhaps a restaurant "sample size" ketchup
    container could be carried to make this effect even more realistic ;)
    <BR>
        90% of my punctures are due to a nasty local weed called "puncture vine"
    (for obvious reasons).  Looks like a pea-size mine with protruding spikes:
    very nasty!
    <BR>
        I used slime once.  Got a puncture from, of all things, a golf tee (the
    little wooden thingy that holds a golf ball erect when you hit it).  The
    hole was so large that the slime didn't work to save the tube going flat.
    Back then I didn't carry a spare tube and the repair was frustratingly
    difficult because the slimy goo kept coming out, preventing a patch from
    holding.  After 2 or 3 tries, I finally got one to hold long enough for me
    to get home.  Also, the slime adds a LOT of weight to the tire.
    <BR>
        I don't like using the small glue tubes that come with patch kits.  Once
    you open them, even though you only need a small bit for the repair, the
    glue will inevitably be dried out and useless the next time you need it.  I
    just put on my spare tube and carry the flat one home.  When I've
    accumulated a small batch of tubes to repair I do them all at once using a
    large bottle of glue (cheap, doesn't dry out) in the comfort of my garage.
    <BR>
        As the puncture vine is seasonal, I find myself doing repairs only once
    during a few months of the year that I get these sort of flats.
    <BR>
        Birdy has a new Kevlar tyre which I've put on my rear wheel.  I'm
    curious to see if that will make a difference regarding punctures.

    I did use Slime but got so fed up with the leaky mess that ensued whenever I needed to take the wheel out (for greasing bearings, etc) that in the end I threw the tube away.  Plus the extra weight slopping around at the periphery of the wheel did nothing for the wheel's balance.  The manufacturer's claim that it would evenly distribute itself around the tube doesn't seem to hold at North of Scotland temperatures.
    <BR>
    I can thoroughly endorse the use of a track pump.  Get a version that does Schrader and Presta valves automatically, however - on my old Specialized pump it was a terrible fiddle taking out the chuck innards and reversing them all the time.  Plus get a big gauge.  They may be expensive, but it means you can get away with cheapie pocket pumps for emergency on bike use.

    1) the front wheel retaining hook - fashioned by an extra bend in the

    2) the rear retaining strap clips in and out in seconds, and holds the back
    up, although some users with heavy loads have found the rubber compresses
    sufficiently to disengage the unit, and may also stretch the webbing - we are
    trying to resolve that detail.


Subject: Removing the steerer
  <LI>{Krip Tick, Sep 2000}
    I was trying to service the headset bearing last night which I've not done
    before. I slackened the 6mm allen screw revealed by folding the handlebars
    down and then hit the screw quite hard with a rod and hammer but the steerer
    and forks remained locked together. Am I doing something wrong or do I need
    to just hit it even harder? I'm a bit worried about bruising the headset
    cups and cones with such brute force.
    TIA

    Make sure you hit the bottom of the allen bolt, not the top (i.e. use
    a drift which is smaller than a 6mm allen key, or use the key itself) -
     otherwise you can damage the bolt. It does need quite a lot of
    force, and once you've tapped the bolt down you may also need to
    wrench the steerer sideways. Stand in front of the bike and hold
    the front wheel with your feet, then twist the bars.

    Carrying a patch kit and a tube with a full sized bike has the benefit that
    if the puncture is to the rear wheel and easily identified, it's often
    possible to effect a repair without removing the wheel (less of an issue
    obviously with front wheel). But can this ever be managed on a bike with 16"
    wheels?

    Thanks for the input on punctures - very depressing! I just cannot

    <BR>
    I take some peoples views regarding surfaces but there is no choice.
    <BR>
    As for all the useful & helpful preparations for failure - well, I
    think it confirms my view that Brompton cycling is inherently

    This was confirmed yesterday when the rear sprocket fractured & I
    lost all my drive when I was expecting to do a 30 mile journey.
    <BR>
    Since new in April 1999 & 4650 miles the history is:-
    1 - Totally inadequate brakes & broken cable until suitable blocks
    found.
    2 - 30-40 punctures.
    3 - Split rear wheel rim
    4 - fractured handlebars.

    But we've had two Bromptons for over ten years and have had absolutely no
    trouble at all with them, apart from one broken spoke and a couple of
    punctures - the bikes have been used on some fairly poor on-road surfaces in
    Ireland and Norway as well as UK and our experience with full-sized bikes
    has been less favourable (although difficult to compare because our
    full-sized bikes will always get stolen within 5 years, unlike the Brompton)

    I agree - this is totally unacceptable. But I'd also say totally unusual.
    Possible explanations:
    a) Badly made example. I can't comment as I've not owned a recent one, I'm
    still riding my 1987 L3!
    b) You ride in an environment which inflicts huge wear and tear on the B.
    c) You treat the bike harshly and unsympathetically.
    <BR>
    I'm sorry that Brompton cycling has been inherently unreliable for you but I
    assure you that most riders don't have that experience. I wouldn't use mine
    for a daily commute if it let me down all the time.

Subject: RE: Reliability & Punctures
  <LI>{Mindak Dietmar, Sep 2000}
    My total milage is approx. 5000, and your list reads just like mine. I only
    have to add about a dozen broken spokes (but that issue was solved when the
    wheel was rebuild due to the split rim). Also I might add about a dozen more
    punctures and a new chain, which I replaced at approx. 3000 miles due to
    lenghtening.
    <BR>
    Apart from that so far I needed 4 front light brackets. They broke through
    vibration. But the lamp is non- original (lumotech standlicht), and might
    stress the bracket more than the very light and primitive original. The last
    time the bracket broke the lamp fell into the front spokes and was damaged
    (albeit still usable).
    <BR>
    There were 5 or 6 (lost count) new rear tubes. Four rear tyres (Raleigh, 2x
    Primo, Schwalbe)and two front ones, a new right hand pedal (left side is
    foldable and appears to be more robust than the rh one). Judging by the
    noise it makes the bottom bracket will need attention soon.
    <BR>
    If I hadn't done most of the jobs myself (apart from the wheel rebuilding)
    I'm convinced that the maintenance cost of the Brompton would be close to or
    worse than the maintenance cost of my car. It has a 10 000 mile service
    interval, so far no unscheduled stops, and the service cost about 500.- DM
    (about 160.- Pound Sterling).
    <BR>
    My daughters mountain bike (medium price range) has done a lot more miles
    and needed only one set of tyres and the very occasional puncture repair.

  <LI>{Gough, Philip G, Sep 2000}
    This issue of reliability unsurprisingly has been well gone over several
    times on this list.  The extreme variation in people's experience of
    Brompton use is the really interesting fact.  My previous input to this
    topic started with the physical aspect of the rider - there is no doubt that
    a 14 stone (196lb) rider is going to stress and accelerate wear and tear
    much more than a relatively puny individual such as myself who cannot muster
    more than 135lbs - like the difference of over half a hundredweight of
    luggage which few, in the developped world anyway, would strap onto a
    conventional diamonnd frame let alone  a portable bike.
    The other highly variable element in these discussions is the range of uses
    to which the Brompton bicycle is employed.  I have always regarded it as an
    essentially urban machine intended for shorter distance domestic and
    commuting purposes.  It is a tribute to the design that it has been used
    with apparent success for epic heavily laden camping trips in
    wilder parts, but that is not because of intrinsic suitability but because
    of the folding which makes it transportable by train or bus.
    I too have had a sprocket split (the old 3/32 inch type), loose spokes on
    the old steel rims, and quite worn out a few Raleigh Record tyres - but I
    have used the machine for almost every working day  in the 11 years that I
    have owned it and I can't imagine life without it.  I calculated that I have
    spent on maintenance 80 per cent of the cost of a new T5 in this period,
    including 2 new handbuilt alloy wheels and a new rear fork assembly which
    was also rebushed later.
    I avoid car driving as much as possible, so my meagre 3500 miles of motoring
    last year cost a huge whack in fixed overheads, petrol, depreciation, hidden
    overheads of pollution, global warming contribution etc . A lot more than 11
    years of bike repairs.
    It is really sad that people are put off this wonderful bike by bad
    experiences, analysis of these bad experiences is essential to see where the
    quality shortfall has occurred.  Problems with the early models were due to
    having to use whatever components that were available, which were not
    necessarily well suited to the stresses of a small wheel bike.

    I have another cause of repeated punctures to add to the list. Several times
    I have had a (non-Brompton) puncture from a splinter of glass, I repaired
    the puncture but realise that the glass was still embedded in the tyre. A
    few miles more riding and the glass punctures the inner tube again. So when
    you have found the puncture, check the tyre in the same region for fragments

    I don't know how we compare in the quantity stakes, but I did spend 5 years
    in a garage repairing punctures on all manner of things including builders'
    plant among other mechanic's duties. At a really wild guess, I can
    guesstimate 3 that failed. Compare this with two tubes where the valve-patch

    and the vehicle still being used !

    Carefully examine the tyre for holes that look new or are glass filled. Pump

    Mine's a month or 2 older. I can't say I've done the mileage, I don't count
    them. The bike is treated as a tool, not as a Sunday leisurely rider.
    Despite being 13St10 and muscly built, I've had creaks out of several things
    but nothing's broken. The only unaccountable failure I've had was the rear
    brake cable nipple coming out of the brake lever. No cable breakages nor
    brake parts failing despite me getting the levers back to the handlebars on
    odd occasions - and this with the brakes adjusted properly.
    <BR>
    The only "failure" I'd complain about is the rusting in the seat post tube
    which started within 3 months of use.

    <BR>
    You must be a key hole surgeon then?  ;-)
    <BR>
    Seriously though, 30 - 40 punctures in 1 1/2 years is staggering, a-typical
    and totally unacceptable for any bike. If you always repair punctures with
    the wheels in situ then I'm certain that's part of the cause of your
    misfortune.
    Doing it this way means:
    <BR>
    It's much harder to check that the tube isn't being trapped between the tyre
    bead and rim when reassembling.
    <BR>
    It's well nigh impossible to check the entire inside of the tyre for glass
    fragments that just penetrate to the inside
    <BR>
    <BR>
    The inner tube is likely to be replaced so that it's stretched in one part
    of it's circumference and crumpled and/or twisted diametrically opposite
    which will cause chafing punctures.
    <BR>
    It's just such an apallingly fiddly way of doing it!
    <BR>
    My very carefully evolved puncture repair technique involves:
    <BR>
    Always removing the tyre completely so you can check the entire inside and
    outside of the tyre carcass for sharp bits.
    <BR>
    Use loads of talc both on the tube and inside the tyre when initially
    fitting a new tube. This really helps by lubricating the tube so it can
    settle into the most comfortable and unstretched/untwisted position inside
    the tyre.
    <BR>
    Of course having all this talc means you must be careful to remove it in the
    punctured area before applying glue. Wipe it off with a little moisture and
    then roughen up with sandpaper. I use an angle grinder when I'm at home for
    speed!
    <BR>
    Fit just one side of the tyre to the rim and then inflate the tube so that
    it's the same softness as a sausage before feeding it back into the tyre -
    about two pump strokes. If it's completely uninflated then it's not going to
    untwist and distribute itself evenly and the flatness of its shape means
    it's much more likely to be trapped under the tyre bead. If it's too hard
    then it'll be difficult to replace the tyre bead without using levers.
    <BR>
    NEVER use levers to replace a tyre - it's just so easy to pinch the tube -
    evolve steel fingers if necessary, these are also useful for squeezing the
    patches on really hard. It helps if you squeeze the tyre beads together at
    one point so that they can sit in the deepest part of the well of the rim at
    one part of its circumference and then hold the rim on the ground with your
    toes at this point and then pull the tyre up diametrically to the other side
    of the rim so that you transfer as much 'slack' as you can to this side of
    the wheel to make pushing the final few inches of bead over the lip of the
    rim with your fingers as easy as possible.
    <BR>
    Always remember to push the valve in towards the circumference of the tyre
    and then pull it back towards the wheel centre before inflating - this
    ensures that this part of the tube at least is not trapped under the bead.
    Novices invariably neglect this step and experience a puncture after bump
    bumping about a mile down the road on a trapped tube.
    <BR>
    Squidge and knead the tyre all round to encourage the tube to fill the outer
    circumference away from the tyre beads.
    <BR>
    Only now should you reinflate.
    <BR>
    If you're an urban cyclist then about 90% of your punctures should be being
    caused by broken glass (damn all the pissheads out there). Small glass chips
    rarely penetrate in one go but actually can take some weeks to cut their way
    right through the tyre casing - though much quicker in the rain as water
    acts as a lubricant for high friction rubber. For this reason, I've found
    that the most effective puncture prevention strategy is to weekly or so,
    under a strong light very carefully inspect the tyres from the outside,
    probing every slit and hole and flicking out any flecks of glass with a semi
    pointed tool. You can count the relative frequency of clear, brown and green
    glass to establish the drinking preferences of your local population. I have
    a pair of smooth jawed very fine pointed pliers that I normally use in my
    electronics work. These are ideal but at over 30 quid I couldn't recommend
    everyone to rush out and buy a pair.
    <BR>
    These procedures may sound lengthy but overall they save tens of hours over
    a year, I get about 4 to 6 punctures in a year of a very considerable
    cycling distance.

    Mostly very sound advice.  I would avoid talc, as it is a relative of

    If you do patch tubes, a good rule of thumb give up and replace the tube

    I would venture to guess that few people realize that talc, which many of us
    have used around the shop and house for a lifetime is a known severe lung
    irritant on a par with asbestos, due to its similarly structured tiny,
    sharp, needle-like hard particle structure -- much worse than fiberglass
    insulation, around which most people wear respirators these days -- and most
    probably carcinogenic.
    <BR>
    It works so well, as a dry lubricant though, that I am eager to find a good
    substitute. What about chalk dust, or some other relatively inert, but
    softer material? (Anything that interacts with water, like, say, cornstarch,
    would probably not be suitable.)

    As someone who spends altogether too much time around chalk dust, I don't

    All the puncture repair outfits I have ever had have come with either a
    puffer bottle of chalk dust or, more usually, a block of chalk and a piece
    of sandpaper that can use to "grate" chalk over the tube.   Works for me.

    Thanks for all the puncture replies - the one below (removed as it
    was very long) was particularly useful. MAny of the things stated
    I had already adopted. The 20-30 punctures were early & all due to
    penetration - around here it is firstly slivers of whatever stone is
    used on our roads & secondly glass. My current problem is how to get
    over the tape "rub" punctures (fairly rare - usually one in life of a
    case) as the slime dosn't seem to be recommended. BTW I havn't had a
    any penetration punctures since using tape & waiting to see if the
    filleted tube covers solve it.
    <BR>
    In relation to reliability from my list of woes on Monday I forgot
    the broken pedal!
    <BR>
    It seems that the overall views of the contributors to the list that
    pedal cycles are an unreliable (& not particuluarly economic) form of
    transport & that is how the world is. As I said before - very
    depressing!

Subject: RE: RE: Punctures & reliability
  <LI>{Ian Charles, Sep 2000}
    I wouldn't have thought it true that this was the overall view of
    contributors to this list that pedal cycles are unreliable. As in so many
    other cases, people are less likely to write just to say that for them, the
    cycle is reliable. Complaints are always more easily heard.
    <BR>
    One thing I think should be borne in mind: I drive as well as cycle, as I'm
    sure do other contributors. Cars have increased dramatically in reliability
    since I first drove in the late 1960's, and also in comfort and performance,
    which is one of the reasons I feel it is so difficult to get motorists to
    leave them behind these days even for short journeys. But when something
    needs repair, the cost is horrendous and as far as I can see there is very
    little these days that the enthusiastic amateur can do to rectify ignition
    problems or engine adjustment. These can only be carried out by garages with
    sophisticated equipment which usually diagnose the replacement of whole
    modules rather than the small parts such as plugs, points, etc from
    yesteryear. Basically, if your modern car breaks down, you're stuffed until
    it's returned to the dealer - even the roadside organisations are limited
    much more these days to empty fuel tank, etc.
    <BR>
    Point is, with bikes - as we can see from all the suggestions involving
    household powders, glues, basic mechanical tools etc, even fingers - it is
    still possible (a) for almost anyone to effect basic repairs (whatever the
    different views are on how to repair a puncture) and (b) for almost anyone
    to make a (possibly unique) improvisation in carrying those repairs out when
    on the road and without a full workshop available. Try repairing the
    ignition block on your car when it suddenly packs up. Toxic or not, talc is
    of no help...
    <BR>
    As for the question of cost, this is a contentious area and it is not my
    intention to start a huge debate since it is possibly off the theme of
    Brompton-talk. But surely one must consider overall cost (environment) when
    looking at the bike as transport and in that respect surely it must rate
    with the train at the most economic end of the scale, while the car must be
    at the other end.

Subject: Re: Punctures: Glue
  <LI>{Bob Gelman, Sep 2000}
    The only patch glue available to take on the bike here in the US comes in
    small tubes with a screw top.  Thirty years ago, or so, I was able to get
    glue (I think it came from Germany) that came in tiny red or orange "pill
    sized" gel- like containers.  It was a single use product so you didn't have
    the "dried out when you need it" problem.
    <BR>
    I wonder if this product is still available anywhere (in Europe?).  It was a
    great idea!
    <BR>
    It's even hard to find a large "shop size" container of glue to use at home.
    When I was a kid they used a metal can with a brush in the lid in all the
    bike shops (maybe a pint) and in auto garages when there were still car
    inner tubes to repair [I wonder what kids use now in pools and on the snow?
    Those old car tubes were cheap, durable, and lots of fun!].  I made the
    discovery, when I found out that these cans where no where to be found, that
    "Elmers Contact Cement" works well, is cheap, and comes in a fairly large
    plastic bottle with a brush in the lid.  This is what I use when I do my
    "batch repairs" at home.

    I see no reason to replace a tube only because it has two patches. IMHO the
    repair when properly done is as good as the original tube. I replace the
    tube when damage occurs on an already patched area, so that overlapping
    repairs would result.

    I'm very sorry Jeff, that I have to disagree on this one. But I am
    certainly _not_ sharing that view. Quite to the contrary: I find my
    Brompton+Bus+Train mobility solution far superior to whatever
    alternative I can imagine, including cars, both for reliability and for
    economical reasons: I go where I want without accidents or traffic jams,
    for far less guilders per kilometer.
    <BR>
    What I _am_ interested in, is your weight, your "mode of cycling" (rough
    or cautious), and the average condition of the roads you use. This would
    put all those failures into proper perspective. I haven't had any of the
    problems you mentioned, except for having to stop the brake blocks from
    eating my rims by replacing them with Koolstops, but you could call me
    lightweight (61kg), and I do have a moderate mode of cycling on our
    mostly well maintained roads (Netherlands: cyclepath country).

    	This is what I was longwindedly trying to say.  When I said that my
    11 years-old T5 has cost 80 percent of a new model to maintain, I forgot
    that it still has a secondhand sale value so the overall cost of ownership
    on disposal is about 480 UK pounds minus about 200 recouped on selling.  The
    net cost is thus less than 300 UK pounds or 25 UK pounds per year of
    ownership.

    Whilst car have become increasingly reliable and sophisticated, its still
    possible to do some routine maintenance and repairs that occur frequently
    such as changing the oil, blown bulbs, ignition cable, spark plugs .... but
    emissions has made distributor, timing, and gas/air mixture taboo.  For the
    B, nearly all parts can be user serviced with proper instruction, and few
    parts are custom and trouble free such as the frame & handlebars.

    A reliable car to begin with is vital to minimize the frequency of routine

        When they figure the cost per mile of operation of an automobile here in

    the costs of operation; gas, repairs, tires, insurance, depreciation,
    parking, etc.
    <BR>
        If you want to know the cost/mile (km) of operating a bike you have to
    do the same thing.  I'm sure it's only a very few cents ($US) per mile, a
    VERY small fraction of what car ownership costs.  Has anyone ever figured it
    for themselves?

    If you bought a new Brompton every year and threw it away when the 12 months
    had expired, it would still only be a fraction of the cost of running a car.
    A new car in the UK is said to lose twenty five percent of its value the
    moment it's driven from the garage where it was purchased.

    It would be interesting to compare the cost of a Brompton with more
    conventional bikes, but even then there are difficulties. There must be many
    of us who combine using our Brompton with some form of public transport
    where otherwise a car would have been used because the bike journey would
    have been too lengthy or arduous. How does one measure that?
    <BR>
    It does seem to me that if someone is using a bike as a principal means of
    transport, carrying heavy loads, riding on rough surfaces and not needing to
    take advantage of the Brompton's foldability/portability, why not just use a
    mountain bike instead with fat tyres? I'm sure I'm not the only person who
    has both types of bike and chooses the more appropriate one for a particular
    purpose.

        When they figure the cost per mile of operation of an automobile here in
    the USA (this is used a lot in figuring tax deductions), they look at ALL
    the costs of operation; gas, repairs, tires, insurance, depreciation,
    parking, etc.
    <BR>
        If you want to know the cost/mile (km) of operating a bike you have to
    do the same thing.  I'm sure it's only a very few cents ($US) per mile, a
    VERY small fraction of what car ownership costs.  Has anyone ever figured it
    for themselves?

Subject: Brompton running costs
  <LI>{Peter Amey, Sep 2000}
    I have found this thread quite interesting.
    <BR>
    I would say my impression of 9000 miles commuting on my B was that it had
    been very good.  However, if I list everything that I have changed it looks
    rather less good (list below).  The good news is that the parts are very
    cheap compared to car parts (or even fashionable mountain bike parts) and
    that the work is easy to do myself.  The cost would probably be very
    significant if everything on my list had involved paying a bike shop to do
    the work.
    <BR>
    To reinforce the view that the manner of usage is important I would say that
    the parts replacement rate has reduced dramatically since I stopped using a
    gravel canal path and found a road route to work instead.  I weigh about 185
    lbs and 90%+ of my mileage has been with a laden front bag.  I also ride
    fairly hard I think.
    <BR>
    Replacements @ 9000 miles
    <BR>
    5 speed hub  (under warranty - failed in first few 100 miles).
    2 rims       (new ones lasting much better with kool stop blocks)
    1 front hub
    1 dynamo     (disintegrated bearings)
    2 rack stays (dynamo mounting point failures - the first took a Nordlicht
    with it - I now have an extra reinforcement strip to protect the current
    expensive S6 dyno)
    1 handlebar
    1 front main frame (replaced under warranty - and Brompton did a lot of
    other little jobs at the same time I noticed)
    1 folding pedal bearing (Brompton exchange service)
    3 chains
    1 frame clamp bolt (fatigue crack on the clamp)
    2 rear sprockets (13 tooth, the current 14 tooth seems to be indestructible)
    1 rear light (corroded reflector)
    1 rear brake cable outer (corroded internally)
    1 bottom bracket (actually not replaced yet but it's ready to be)
    <BR>
    I can't remember exactly how many tyres I have used (perhaps 4) or punctures
    I have had (<12).
    <BR>
    I have never failed to complete a journey under my own steam (all the
    critical failures were detected by inspection rather than failing in use).
    <BR>
    regards
    <BR>

    If you bought a new Brompton every year and threw it away when the 12 months
    had expired, it would still only be a fraction of the cost of running a car.
    A new car in the UK is said to lose twenty five percent of its value the
    moment it's driven from the garage where it was purchased.

    In regard to my weight I'm 86kg
    I carry a maximum of 7 or 8kg on my front carrier rack (occasionally
    10) - what is the maximum?
    I've only done less than 20 miles off road (only on good compressed
    surface in the dry) because the bike feels like it's going to shake
    itself to bits.
    Average road surface is well tarmaced probably 5-10mm shattered hard
    roadstone which gives constant vibration - Some worse some better.
    Quite a lot where the surface breaks to give a 10-20mm vibromassage
    surface.
    Virtually all surfaces have a covering of sharp grit & broken glass.
    E. Southampton which is where I work out from is fairly hilly.
    I do find I am "driving" the whole time. My broken sprocket is
    "burred" by the chain on the driving faced of the teeth.
    I do journeys of up to 60 miles for pleasure on country roads - most
    with reasonable worn smooth surfaces.
    I never drive up curbs but will hop up ledges of up to 25mm - I have
    never had a pinch puncture.

    nix nix!  I just haven't been posting lately :-)
    <BR>
    I have had exactly one flat on my old MTB in 12 years.
    <BR>
    I owned the same ratty old MTB for 12 years, did almost no
    maintenance, and it took me everywhere I wanted to go.
    I don't ride the B as much locally, it's more of a travel
    bike (as in travelling on business and wanting to have a
    bike wherever I go) so it has low miles on it;  I can't
    speak to its reliability under daily use.  my daily
    commute bike has always been a fat-tyre MTB.
    <BR>
    The B imho, and I know a lot of you all will disagree, is a
    specialty bike.  It folds up and travels unobtrusively on
    aeroplanes as luggage, avoiding the swingeing great punitive
    bike fees those thugs otherwise charge us.  That's why it
    commands the price it does...  I only have to take 16 flights
    (8 round trips) saving a $50 bike fee each time, to pay for the
    $800 basic bike.  So I don't really expect it to stand up to
    the kind of pounding, bashing, trailer- hauling, rain, salt
    spray, etc to which my work bike is subjected regularly.  I
    consider it an expensive luxury item like a minox camera or a
    laptop computer -- expensive because of its compactness and
    ingenuity, and to be treated with some care.  I realize this
    is rank heresy, so I apologize, it's just my personal take
    on the little red folder.
    <BR>
    anyway, back to pedal bike reliability.
    <BR>
    I have never had a chain jump the rings.  I have occasionally
    got stuff jammed into the chain/cone juncture -- tough
    vegetation, or on one memorable occasion the strings of
    a hat that fell off my rear rack.  I once had a tyre develop
    a hernia (detected the nasty whompling sensation where it
    was rubbing against the brake assembly, stopped, released
    that brake, and rode home very carefully to replace the
    tyre and tube).  And I'm not one of those maintenance freaks
    who has the bike in pieces every other Saturday so that I
    can admire my reflection in the inside bearing surfaces.
    It's a vehicle.  I use it.  When it starts to perform badly
    I fix it, investing the minimum in cash and effort.  I
    treated my cars, back when I owned cars, the same way --
    but "the minimum" was a heckuva lot more.
    <BR>
    I have only twice had to walk home wheeling a bike -- once was
    aforementioned flat which I got when riding across an open
    field in tall grass, and picked up a sharp thorn/twig.  the
    other was when a car jumped the kerb and pretzeled my bike
    (the one before the MTB, so more than 12 years ago) where it
    was locked to a street-sign post.
    <BR>
    I don't live in a bike-friendly environment, though it's not as
    bad as say NYC or urban London.  Local road surfaces are quite
    bad, RR xings are hellish, and there's a lot of broken glass
    about, thanks to (a) drunken slob vandals and (b) the
    neighbourhood recycling trucks which tend to drop bits of their
    cargo now and then.  The reason I don't get flats, imho, is
    that I keep my tyres as hard as they will stand, 80lbs+.  I
    don't have kevlar liners or any other fancy stuff.  Slime is an
    exploded theory imho. Messy, unpleasant, and of dubious
    efficacy.
    <BR>
    Anyhoo... about cost/benefit:  I had 12 years of transport out
    of a bike that probably cost me all of US$500 over that 12
    years -- $250 for the bike, and maybe as much as $250 in parts
    and one pro tune-up at the 8-year mark.
    <BR>
    I would say the pedal cycle is a completely reliable and
    incredibly cost-effective form of transportation.
    <BR>
    I now have a new bike (and the old one as well, sigh... just
    can't bear to get rid of it).  since it is new and shiny, I
    actually washed it once after getting some mud on the frame :-)
    I was washing it and giving the chain a quick clean, etc. last
    weekend and thinking how many hours my neighbour was spending
    washing his car and tuning it up.  Actually he owns about 5 or
    6 cars and 3 motorbikes, so you could say that they dominate
    his spare hours completely.  This is how he has fun, so
    chacun a son gout :-)
    <BR>
    I was done with the bike massage in maybe an hour, maybe a bit
    less.  It's not just the money it saves you.  It's the time.  I
    used to work on my own cars, and ohboy do I look back in anger
    on the hours and hours of my life that I spent tinkering with
    those balky critters.
    <BR>
    bikes rule ok
    <BR>
    I'll shut up now :-)  sorry, but that depressing diss of the
    pedal cycle got a rise out of me.

Subject: Re: Cost/mile (km) of bike vs. car
  <LI>{James Harold Crouse, Sep 2000}
    I see at least two interesting issues here:
    <BR>
    Money costs: When figuring money costs, be sure to start with the cost of
    gasoline per mile. But then add the cost of the car, the cost of
    insurance, the cost of hospitalization and medical bills, etc. This will
    make the cost of riding a bicycle look even better compared to the
    automobile.
    <BR>
    Speed: It takes about an hour to go 60 miles in a car (say). The same
    distance may take (say) 4 hours by bike. However, when comparing the time
    it takes for the car and bike, make sure you add the time you must work to
    pay for the car, the time you must commute to hold the job you need to pay
    for the car, the time spent working to pay for the insurance the car
    requires, the time spent in the hospital from car accidents, etc. Adding
    these times to the one hour needed to go 60 miles in the car makes going
    60 miles by car take a lot longer than by biccycle!!!
    <BR>
    <BR>
    So, the bike wins out as costing less than the car and allowing faster
    travel!!

    OK, suprise.
    <BR>
    CAR:
    I have (garaged) a Nissan PU bought used @ $11K.   Total expense since '94
        Capitalization costs -- 7000.  (or $6000, depending on resale)
        garage (equivalent)  --  7500.  (@$125/mth)
        expenses               --  5850  (gas, insurance, register, tickets,
    everything else)
                            ________
                             $20350.  for 1/95 - 12/99
    Miles driven in this time were low, 32,200 total.  So, cost per mile are
    about $0.64/.
    <BR>
    BIKES:
    I've bought 5 bikes (and one total rebuild) in this time.  Having spent
    ~$4600, they are now worth (conservatively) ~$1600-1900 I guess.  So Capital
    costs of ~$3000.
    <BR>
        Total expenses = $5210.  (repairs, panniers, lights, locks, trailers, ...)
        Capital costs    =   3000.  (high cost value; if resale is higher, this
    $$$ drops)
        garage (equiv)   =   4140.   (at $60./mth)
                                  ________

    So bike costs have run about $12,350. for the 5.7 yr period.  Does not
    include some transit costs, but those are small (holidays mostly); most
    commuting is entirely by bike.
    <BR>
    Hard to estimate mileage.  Have been averaging 400-600/ mth since I stopped
    driving.  But for the entire time (5.7 yrs) the costs per mile will probably
    be high.  Jsut because my miles were probably low during the first few yrs.
    Say 15-20,000 for the 5.7 yrs. (Didn't start commuting til '98).
    <BR>
    Still, it looks to be at least  $0.64/mi. for the truck.  And about the same
    for all the bikes, up to this point.
    <BR>
    [A significant figure in both calc's was the garage.  I figures half the cost
    of a garage for the bikes, though they really take up MORE space.  But I
    could probably put them in the back yard and use the side door.  Can't do
    that with a truck; and if left on the street, the parking tickets would
    probably be  as high or higher than the garage costs.]
    <BR>
    Sadly this is not what I expected when I started pulling the figures
    together.  On the plus side, the bikes should be cheaper to run from here on
    out.  No gas, insurnce, and they are almost capitalized out, with cheaper
    "garage" costs.  The truck still has $4000 resale (vs $1600 for the bikes),
    with higher garage and insurance costs; so that will continue to be more
    expensive than operating a bike.  But  the idea of "pennies per mile' doesn't
    seem to bear out, from my expenses.  (I do drop dollars on the bikes like
    that; and am notoriously cheap on the truck.  Still, ...)
    <BR>
    Thats pretty accurate.  Comments?

    Don't forget - car running costs (especially gas) are ridiculously low in
    the US compared to almost everywhere in the developed world (and certainly
    Europe). Second - without wishing to hammer the environmentalist message too
    far - the costs which have been listed are the immediate, direct, personal
    costs to the owner. What about the cost to the environment caused by the car
    compared to the bikes - manufacture, consumption, repair, disposal?

        1.  I think a lot of us spend $ on our bikes the same way we'd buy
    presents for a girl (boy) friend.  Fiddling with gear/sprockets, trying new
    tires, a new horn, etc.  Certainly some people do this with their cars.
    Eliminating these surplus expenditures would bring down your costs.
    <BR>
        2. You compared 5 bikes to 1 car.  Certainly many could have done their
    riding on a single bike (like in the 3rd world where a bike is a primary
    means of transportation).  Could 4 of the bikes be looked upon as "surplus
    expenditures" ?
    <BR>
        3.  Hanging (like bats) the bikes in the garage means they really don't
    take any space/expense  at all (unless your garage didn't come with your
    apt/house), unless you had another use for the rafter space.

    Yes.  Good point.  But that brings up the "reliability" issue;  I've gone for
    'more' bikes, jsut so I don't have to mess with a flat tire, or a rubbing
    sound, or whatever that v day -- if I don't car to, and can still get where
    I'm going in the morning.  (Sometimes I don't feel comfortable with even
    "just two".)

    <BR>
    OK.  Just for the sake of argument -- say I had a Super-Brompton(TM).  Go
    anywhere -- take anywhere.  I could ditch the garage -- 1/3 of my cost right
    there.  Since its a Super-Brompton(TM), Cap costs remain the same (probably
    alot less, as I imagine they have a high resale price/value).  That is my
    second 'third -- cut in half.  Then the last third -- lights. locks,
    raingear, trailer ...  Well I have had to buy 5 sets of computers, lights,
    locks ....  So if we cut that by 1/3, then the numbers would look like this:
    <BR>
        SuperB:
            Expenses -- $3400
            Cap Cost  --   1500
            garage      --        0
                        ________
                         $4900 for 15-20,000 miles,
    <BR>
    or $0.25/ -- 0.33/ per mile, as a guess.  That is still being pretty
    free-spending
    so it could (have) gone to maybe $0.15 or 0.20/ mile; and even less if I
    wanted to skimp on having a great machine.   And of course the ratios drop
    the more you ride!
    <BR>
    (This intrigues me.  Think I'll keep an eye on it.)
    <BR>
    All these expenses are still less than a car; even a beater car I believe.
    And the rewards are ...

    Hang about. I'm talking about the perfumed talc that some people liberally
    coat quite delicate parts of their anatomy with on a regular basis. Are
    those people who use it in this way dropping like flies or is this so much
    hearsay?. No trace of a health warning on any of the ones I've seen in the
    chemist. From its slipperiness I would have guessed the crystals are loosely
    bonded ring shaped layers like graphite but that's just a guess. I'm amazed
    to hear all this. Chalk would seem a poor substitute as gymnasts, climbers
    etc use it to improve the grip of their hands.

    It is amazing that talc is still available for personal use, but you might have noticed that talc is no longer used for baby powder at least in the US.  That product has changed to corn starch.
    <BR>
    As far as all this talk about reliability, I find the Brompton probably more reliable for my uses than conventional bikes largely because the chain never falls off like every derailleur bike I have ever ridden does.  But generally I am not happy with the reliability of conventional bikes.  This is a market situation: Most of the market does not treat biking as serious transport but as leisure activity and is cost sensitive.  I hope this changes before the oil runs out, but I am not holding my breath, as we say.
    <BR>
    I want a bike with no chain at all that can shift while stopped.  But still light and efficient, recumbent front wheel drive, blah blah blah...

    	Second bike could be made rather less in cost.  And 3d bike
    	*way*  cheaper.  Flat tire quick-remedy can be partly-accomplished

Subject: miles per real hour... some musings
  <LI>{De Clarke, Sep 2000}
    (If anyone can track down this statistic, I'd sure
    appreciate a reference.) Some years ago I read "somewhere
    online" that the average cyclist can make about 12 mph
    over average urban/suburban terrain -- excluding, say, the
    hillier bits of SF CA, the Peak in Hong Kong, etc.  The
    average car driver in light traffic can make 20 mph over
    the same turf.  Car wins!
    <BR>
    Or does it? If you factor in all the time the car driver
    spends, as James said, working to pay for insurance, to
    pay for the car, to pay for registration, repairs, upkeep,
    gasoline etc -- and the time that some car drivers spend
    washing, waxing, waiting at repair shops, standing in line
    at the DMV, driving around looking for a parking space,
    hiking across huge parking lots, whatever -- then the car
    driver makes about the same 12-13mph (that is, real hours
    of life-time invested to cover those same miles) over the
    same terrain.  Can anyone verify this, or track down the
    source of this stat?
    <BR>
    I'm intrigued by this alternative measure of efficiency.
    Money is one thing, but we also have a universal currency,
    and that is time.  We live only so many heartbeats, and
    the hours of our life that we invest in this-and-that are
    a truer indicator of real cost (imho) than the dollars.
    <BR>
    Just supposing for a moment that the 12 mph stat is true:
    <BR>
    If you now factor in gridlocked urban traffic where the
    car driver is trapped in stop-n-go for 2 hours to cover
    20 miles, the cyclist is actually getting there sooner than
    the car driver, and the car driver is down to 6mph if you
    count all the labour time working to pay for the car...
    <BR>
    Which leads me to another interesting consideration of
    distance travelled vs hours worked to accomplish the
    travel.
    <BR>
    Suppose I can buy a plane ticket to Hawai'i for anywhere
    from $600 to $1200 US (round trip) depending on season,
    discounts, whether I'm willing to stay up all night, etc.  --
    and let's say that this is a 5000 mi round trip... and
    that I would have to work say 20 hrs to 40 hrs (at $30/hr,
    a middle-class wage) to pay for that ticket... plus 12 hrs
    in the air (round trip) and an additional 3 hrs each end
    per travel day getting to and from airports, so 24 hrs for
    the travelling itself...  then I've invested say 44 to 64
    hrs of my life to travel 5000 miles.
    <BR>
    113 mph, or 78 mph, depending on the dollar cost of the
    ticket.
    <BR>
    Whereas the car driver, using an allegedly "ordinary and
    everyday" form of transport, considered less special and
    luxurious than air travel, is only getting from 6 to 13
    mph.
    <BR>
    Of course the car driver is travelling in sinful, solitary
    luxury (at least the average US car driver is!), with a
    personal stereo, snacks, a/c, heater, and the illusion of
    complete freedom of movement.  On the other hand, I can
    read a book all the way to HI :-) and though the
    discomfort of coach- class air travel is a byword, if I
    get a window seat at least part of my trip is
    entertaining... the seat is more comfortable in the
    average car... the view is better from the plane :-) Call
    it incalculable, whether 6 hrs in a car is "heavier" or
    "lighter" than 6 hrs in a plane.
    <BR>
    If I paid the same cost/mile (in real hours of my life) to
    get to HI and back as the car driver pays per mile to
    cross town (let's take the charitable 12mph figure, not
    the gridlock 6mph), then I'd invest 417 hrs or (at $30/hr)
    a whopping $12K US, to get there.
    <BR>
    I think this is a voodoo numbers game I'm playing here --
    not as bad voodoo as GNP or GDP, but still more playful
    than serious. but it says something to me about apparent
    speed (the wallclock time between leaving A and arriving
    at B) vs invested life-time per mile...
    <BR>
    Of course, one Canadian doctor says that regular use of
    a bike for transport can add up to 20 years to your
    life expectancy, so maybe our real mph for bike travel
    needs to be weighted for adding hours onto your life
    span!

  <LI>{Ostlers, Sep 2000}
    With all of this cost analysis going on, just a couple of
    thoughts to throw into the hopper.
    <BR>
    (1) I spend about 30 minutes on the daily 8 mile round-trip
        commute. If I were to take the car, it would be about half
        that, say 15 minutes.
    <BR>
        So, at the cost of 15 minutes I get the exercise that a
        driver would have to spend say 45 minutes at the health
        club--perhaps on a stationary bike!--to get (under the
        assumption that real biking is better exercise than stationary
        biking by a 1.5 factor).
    <BR>
        ...and, of course, there is another 15 to 30 minutes expended
        by the driver to get to and from the health club.
    <BR>
        ...and I have to admit that I typically lose a few minutes
        on each end cleaning up after the ride.
    <BR>
    (2) After seeing the position taken that a motorist needs to add
        to his trip time the time needed to work to pay for higher capital
        and maintenence costs, I wonder if there is actually anyone on
        the list who is working fewer hours because of savings attributable
        to the decision to cycle.

    <BR>
    One of the tipper reasons I decided to start bike-commuting was jsut this.
    If I drove, then I had to 'make room' for exercise, which didn't always
    happen.  Whereas, if i *rode*, then I had my exercise already, at minimal
    expense of time.  The savings in gas was jsut the starter-benefit.

    Ps:  Do I *really* want an extra twenty years @ 75-95?  Could I trade that in
    for three years at 25 again?        :)

    I'll second that, and more efficient as well.
    <BR>
    6 October 1999 (Date exercising and cycling started) 222lbs
    8 September 2000 (still cycling) 156lbs and feeling great!!!!
    Less heartbeats per hour though so maybe that truly is the real measure and
    makes up the added 20 years.

    Now THAT sounds like fun. :-)
    <BR>
    I've lost about 10 pounds in six months even though I cycle only about
    50 miles per week (five miles each way to work). I'm now down to about
    240lbs, which as I'm pretty heavily built isn't bad.
    <BR>
    Even so, no wonder I break a few things on this poor Brommy on the
    potholes and kerbs of Leeds!  My Zap adds a fair few extra pounds, and
    I always have a heavy notebook bag on my back. I dread to think what
    the total weight is. Must buy some new brake pads!

    The answer is yes.
    Isn't there some Somerset Maugham story about the man who intended to live
    the good life until sixty? When he reached sixty, he then chickened out on

    As to trading in those years for a couple of years in your mid-twenties, I

Subject: Cycling and Weight Loss
  <LI>{Bob Gelman, Sep 2000}
    Unlike most members of the list, I don't use my folder to commute or as a
    substitute for a car.  For me it is a fun exercise machine.  I congratulate
    Mick on his great progress on getting back into shape.  And I think SHAPE is
    the key word.  As muscle is heavier than fat, a lot of cycling frequently
    does NOT result in that much immediate weight loss.  However, it can result
    in very dramatic changes in the way you look [at yourself in the mirror].
    <BR>
    After all, who cares what they weigh as long as they look and feel good.  If
    we had interplanetary travel, our weight would change all the time!  So if
    you've started a cycling regimen to promote physical fitness ( to "lose
    weight" as most people say) don't despair if you don't see such dramatic
    weight changes as Mick did.  Throw away your scale, but DO keep a watch on
    which hole you use to buckle your belt!
    <BR>
    I do have some indoor exercise equipment.  When using it I almost always
    find myself looking at the clock to see how long it will be before I can
    stop.  I always stop when my "time" is up.  I never say to myself "Hey, this
    is fun; I think I'll go another hour or two."  On my bike, that happens all
    the time.

    I haven't used them but I was in my brilliant local bike shop yesterday and

    > Drop the Zap to see even more dramatic changes!
    <BR>
    I'm sure, but I use my bike for commuting and I'm not always in the
    mood.  There are a couple of place on my trip to work where I hit
    30mph, and one where I hit 35mph. Imagine what those bits are like the
    other way when it's raining, the wind's against me, I've had a long day
    at work, too much lunch, and I've got a cold!
    <BR>
    I've done the trip several times without the Zap and the same amount of
    effort gives me only 7/8mph in places where the Zap assist would let me
    do 10/12mph. The extra speed helps cool me down and generally makes the
    trip more pleasant. The last thing I want is to leave the house and
    pick up my car keys rather than my helmet!

    Indirectly, yes.  I could not have bought my flat 9 years ago (in pricey
    SW London) & run a car at same time.  I later went part-time & certainly
    couldn't keep up house & car payments from the reduced income (was
    supposed to make some more money in the freed-up time, but hasn't yet
    quite worked that way).
    <BR>
    I did chose this place partly as it overlooks 24 hour buses & is a mile
    from 2  railway stations & tube (subway).  It was probably slightly
    cheaper for having no allocated car space.  Having the Brompton means it
    can come up the twisting stair to the flat: safer (& less nuisance
    to neighbours) than leaving it in the communal hall.
    <BR>
    Mad London housing market means I  couldn't afford to do it now, car or no
    car - but that's another tale...

  <LI>{Custfold, Sep 2000}
    You are confusing Ivan Illich's findings that we spend IIRC a third of our
    working effort earning to pay for getting to work in current 'developed
    society because of its unsustainable placing of work, home, and supply points
    where unnecessary travel is required to get between them - it applies mainly
    to cars, but equally to those who use saya folding bike in combination with
    another wasteful commute of tens or even hundreds of miles by train, bus or
    plane.
    <BR>
    The average speed issue is well cover by the London (UK) Travel Survey which
    has consistently returned the bicycle as fastest over a nominal 1.8 mile
    journey, for the following reasons
    <BR>
    1) 90% of the time taken is spent making progress 'on vehicle' the remaining
    10% being going to collect the bike and parking it - folding bikes will
    return even better results.
    <BR>
    2) the average speed of urban traffic is falling as congestion increases,
    whilst the bike remains comparatively immune from this.
    <BR>
    3) you do not have to wait for the bike to arrive and buy tickets - the
    actual journey time for a bus trip in the survey almost matches that for the
    bike but you add nearly 70% to that time in walking to the bus stop, waiting,
    and buying the ticket.

    We both followed similar tenets, and own flats all paid off by the saving of
    not running a car.  A friend reckons on paying off their mortgage 8 years
    early for similar reasons.  In inner London a car space is worth/costs about
    &pound;15,000/dwelling -we've been offered &pound;2000/year to rent out ours (no deal -
    its a nice lawn now)
    <BR>
    We watch with interest the many who are buying upmarket flats locally, and
    absolutely having to 'own' a classy sports soft top, especially as they are
    often parked all day for fear of losing the parking space/the owner is at
    work - usually commuting by train or bus.
    <BR>
    Josephine observes that when deciding to go out with a new partner the better
    bet is one with no car, or a grotty old one that you can be sure they
    actually have paid for, rather than some flashy machine which is 90% owned by
    the bank.
    <BR>
    For the UK a financial assessment in 1989 reckoning up whole life values over
    20 years found that owning and running an average car would come out some
    &pound;75,000 more expensive than owning & running an average house.

    Yes nave=hub I guess. Nave is the Meccano word. Normally it should just buzz
    but the problem is (not only mine, I've read) that it makes nowadays the
    noise of a numer of cans attached to the tail of a cat (when freewheeling).
    As I wrote before: I took the whole thing apart, greased, oiled and adjusted
    but the problem is still there. Construction problem I think and insoluble.

    I don't think so. Mine has *no play* 28 months (probably c. 4000m)
    after being serviced (free) by the kind S-A men at Folder Forum 98.
    This involved fairly extensive dismantling, cleaning & re-greasing.
    It had probably done only about 1000m then but I had just skidded
    sideways and dented the wheel with a hard knock on a roadside post
    on a bend at the bottom of a steep hill descended when too pissed,
    and was rebuilding the wheel, leg luckily not broken on the post.
    <BR>
    Interestingly I discovered the left-hand outer nut loose on checking
    for play just now - I probably forgot to tighten it c 1000 miles ago.
    <BR>
    Usually, ball bearings should be assembled to be fairly tightly
    pre-loaded so that many of the balls will share any further loading.
    My S-A *flexes* under manual force but much less than 1mm at the rim.
    This is mainly elastic compression of balls & race where they contact.

    That's sad. I find it helps to use a mirror - I even carry a small

    front pannier pockets - from that excellent tool shop near the north
    end of Tottenham court road - cheap dental mirrors are also ideal.

    I now adjust it so *most* of the red ring on the indicator chain

    I've had one hole in a tube before and patched it with more than one
    overlapping patches. I think a significant thing is to remove internal
    corners from the holes to stop splits travelling further - under the
    patches. I don't think this is necessary when a correct-sized patch can be

    Do you have any hard figures on that?  ("That" is what "they" would like you
    to believe, so ... its important to independently verify as really being
    cheaper).

    And what about the car <itself> as luggage, to which 'many' restrictions

    <BR>
    Even purely economical, that's not a fair measurement to compare bikes
    and cars.  Miles driven is more than the distance covered.  For the kind
    of travels (or legs thereof) where both bikes and cars are viable, you
    will likely drive a longer route then you would ride (catching the main
    road, avoiding bottlenecks)
    <BR>
    Secondly, the actual displacement themselves are less likely to be
    necessary or even desirable.  When you ride your bike past somewhere you
    want to be, you'd rather think twice then return some other time.  When
    you're driving, the drivers behind you won't let you think once.  A car
    increases your long range mobility, so you're expected to behave by it.
    There are more events you don't really care about where you find
    yourself obliged to show up.  So some miles are wasted.
    <BR>
    And another point, isn't the "keep" value (as opposed to "resale" value)
    of bicycles bigger than for cars?  I mean that when you have a 10 year
    old car, the chassis is starting to rust and most parts are wearing
    out.  There's not much you can do than sell or wait for the next
    expensive part to break.  There may not even be a replacement for it.
    What's left is trash.  Whereas on your 10 year old Brompton, your rear
    wheel and gearbox are just three years old, the handlebars were replaced
    last year etc...  The frame is just scratched, not worn (unless it is
    Aluminium).  Even if you ditch the bike, you still have a bunch of new
    and old components (like a perfectly shaped saddle) that you can reuse
    on any new bike you purchase.

    I think, in that many parts are interchangeable (Detroit destroyed that a
    long time ago), this is true.
    <BR>
    Heard somewhere that the average life of a bike (MTB?) is seven years.  I
    have a 7 yr old MTB, which I want to ditch but, like a Timex, it keeps on
    ticking.  They do start to run up the costs, though (new derailer, seatpost,
    drivetrain, brakes, shifters, water bottle brackets, computers -- all that
    good stuff; so its almost all new at some point).
    <BR>
    But the bike industry is taking its cues from "Detroit" -- brakes, headsets,
    chains, many components are morphing (supposedly for improvements, but try to
    get a 7-speed cassette, roller cam brakes ...) in an effort to *sell/buy*.
    <BR>
    Its nice to know that some things, like B, like S-A, like Brooks, retain
    their integrity.

    contrary to naive laissez-faire capitalist manifestos, doing it

    I'm not sure that anyone has maligned them. Most would agree that the
    price to performance ratio is good. However, many people on this list
    seem to want to get the ultimate out of their Brompton(s). A new set
    of tyres is relatively cheap as upgrades go and the performance
    benefit (compared to say a set of titanium bolts or a carbon fibre
    seatpost) good.

    hmmm... as one curmudgeon to another... I'd be careful with that
    Yuppie label...  people can work like dogs and still never earn
    enough to be yuplets.  and some yups are retiring at 35 on their
    stock options and never working again.
    <BR>
    yeah, some people who own expensive bikes like a B are the same people
    who own twin Acuras (his-n-hers), enough stereo equipment to host a
    major multimedia event, sporting clothes that cost even more than
    the bike, etc. ... and all of it replaced every few years with the
    newest and spiffiest.  I'm sure some such people have B's, though
    I would privately bet they are more likely to buy a Bike Friday --
    'cos it is even more costly, and trendier :-)
    <BR>
    whether this list is "dominated" by stereotypical yuppies I kinda doubt,
    because of the quality of a lot of the postings... I know a number of yuppies
    personally, of various flavours, and their discourse is not very similar
    to what I read here :-)  in fact all they talk about is their bloody
    portfolios, very boring.

    <BR>
    respectfully disagree!  I would love to see people use bikes for their
    health, or for everyone else's health, or on moral grounds...  but a
    lot of people won't, unless there's a financial incentive as well --
    which fortunately there is!

    <BR>
    Avoid the aggravation of traffic eh?  Gee, I'd like to do that, but
    since I'm still sharing the road with those same selfish individuals
    (and at a significant strategic disadvantage) I feel there is still
    some degree of aggravation involved... but I know what you mean :-)
    <BR>
    Hmmm... what an interesting project, "the reasons why I bicycle."  I'd
    like to set up a web page poll, actually, it would be fascinating to
    see how very different all of our reasoning is.
    <BR>
    I'd say my own reasons in order are:
    <BR>
    0.  I just slowly started using the bike more and more over time
        because it was *more convenient*...  so "laziness"...
    <BR>
    1.  increasing disaffection from the US auto-mania, strong desire to
        make my daily life comform to my beliefs (i.e. walk my talk, or rather
        *bike* my talk)...  so "consistency" or "ethics" ...  or even
        "aesthetic disgust" with car culture, oil industry, etc.
    <BR>
    2.  the international community of serious cyclists and cycle advocates
        is a community I really respect and enjoy "being part of" even in
        my very small way...  so "good company" ...
    <BR>
    3a. it's more physical fun than driving, which is not fun any more...
    3b. small clever efficient technology is more intellectual fun than large
        overpowered brute-force technology... less packaged, more room
        for personal ingenuity...
    		so "FUN"
    <BR>
    4.  saves time (life-hours per mile)...  *laziness* again: low-maintenance,
    	low-overhead.
    <BR>
    5.  saves money (saving up for retirement/boat)....
    <BR>
    6.  moderate exercise (my daily runs are not that challenging)...
    <BR>
    <BR>
    gee, I'm enjoying this thread, even though it is not strictly B-related...

    For my part, we don't plan to replace the second
    automobile that recently slipped beyond the "more
    trouble to keep it than kiss it goodbye" threshold.
    <BR>
    I can get anywhere, pretty much, in Albuquerque by
    bicycle--and prefer to. There will be some inconveniences,
    of course, but I'm hoping at this point that the second car
    will prove unnecessary. It wasn't being used much.
    <BR>
    Last Sunday evening my wife drove to cover her
    nursing shift at the hospital. That left
    three daughters, ages 6 to 9, and I with a social
    event to attend, and no car. My wife volunteered to
    drive us and our bikes on her way to work up the hill,
    about 3-4 miles, leaving us the easier mostly
    downhill part to ride home.
    <BR>
    We decided, however, to try biking it all--a stretch
    exercise for the girls--and we made it! The six year
    old was in the trailer, the eight year old pedaled
    but had a tow assist on a rope and the eight year old
    did it all under her own power, an effort that we
    took pains to praise and congratulate.
    <BR>
    The return trip was, of course, easy but we did catch
    a bit of rain.

Subject: Kids in tow
  <LI>{Bob Gelman, Sep 2000}
    Dear Farrell,
    <BR>
        I used a double trail a bike for myself and two kids for a number of
    years (the kids have just graduated to individual bikes).  See:
    http://www.westportcomputers.on.ca/bike/ulti2.html  (The site shows
    liquidation because these were made in Canada; a new company still makes
    them).  I don't know how they would work with a folder; might be a bit much.
    I used a mt bike as the tow.  This is really nice because it is quite light
    and has gears; the kids really enjoyed it.  The nicest thing is that we were
    able to take 20-30 mile tours when my youngest was still on training wheels
    on her own bike.  This is a good way to "take the family" without the car.
    <BR>
        You certainly get noticed on one of these.  I never used the "flag" that
    the manufacturer supplied to enhance being seen.

  <LI>{Ostlers, Sep 2000}
    Bob,
    <BR>
    That's a beaut to be sure. We tried a single-speed, single
    child "trail a bike" style unit once, but the lack of
    gearing made for a real mismatch between the adult
    and the child at road speed. At the time, I could imagine
    something cool as illustrated in your reference URL,
    but I never would have guessed that they existed.
    <BR>
    I don't know, though. We may be getting old enough
    that we couldn't use it long enough to justify the
    investment. How old were your children when it became
    no longer practical?
    <BR>
    As for the lead bike, I doubt I would use a B, either.
    I have a folding MTB that would work well there. Or,
    maybe a tandem, then there would be seats for all
    three...but heading into cost territory
    that might make the second car look attractive again
    ;-).

Subject: Re: Kids in tow
  <LI>{Bob Gelman, Sep 2000}
    Dear Farrell,
    <BR>
        The kids started on this contraption about 3 years ago.  They are now 9
    and 11.  They probably could have used it another year, but it would have
    been a tight fit (they are on the small size).  They really want to feel
    "independent" so I didn't force them to use the trail-a-bike thing any more;
    I wouldn't want to "force" them to ride, in any event.  We all so enjoy our
    rides.  My little girl surprised me by being able to go 10 miles on her 6th
    or 7th ride after first learning to ride her own bike this summer!
    <BR>
        On most of these kid "carriers" you can frequently get back much of what
    they cost when you sell them, so the real expense is the initial outlay.
    The tandem trail-a-bike should be ~$500 if I had to guess; but I have no
    idea as I got mine during the "liquidation" for $330.  It'd recommend it!
    It was terriffic fun.  It allowed us all to go "together" on these very long
    rides.  When you figure only what the final cost (initial minus resale)
    would be, it's a lot less than a trip to Disneyland and a WHOLE LOT more
    fun.
    <BR>
        I did use this with a tandem once.  Wow, that WAS strange.  Four of us
    on one bike.  I felt like a tour bus driver.  It was quite unwieldy but
    manageable.  But I didn't do it again.
    <BR>
        I never did hook it up to my Birdy.  As only the lead bike has brakes,
    and there is a lot of mass going on one of these, I didn't want to take any
    chances with the 3 of us (and we have a lot of big hills here near San
    Francisco).
    <BR>
            Cheers,
    <BR>

    I had one the other day. Pulled out in front of me as we both approached a T
    junction which is why he didn't accelerate away. We were both turning the
    same way so I started to overtake him on the correct side. AS I was
    alongside him, the road ahead was clear and I got in front of him before he
    really got set off again. I held my position - which then held him up. He
    blew his horn at me, I blew mine back at him.

    Since the adjustment needs to be adjusted each time the wheel's removed, it

    Good idea - I've gone the contortionist route with back wheel hanging in the
    air ! However, with the extra cable-pull assembly, it is harder to see the

Subject: Revenge is sweet
  <LI>{PETE ALEX, Sep 2000}
    Fighting cars on a bike ain't right. It's too easy to get squashed. But
    here's an idea I've just read about. A pressure water pistol loaded with car
    brake fluid - a great way to strip paint without melting the plastic pistol.
    A cyclist in Lille, France has been "Shooting" cars that cut him up. If it
    catches on, will there be a folding version?
    <BR>
    Viva la revolution!!! (or something like that).

    In a recent Fiat advertisement in Italy (which I've never seen) a cyclist
    smiles smugly at a car driver while waiting at traffic lights. Equally
    smugly, he props himself against the car.
    At the third set of lights, the advert shows the car accelerating, leaving
    the propped cyclist to fall to the ground.
    Apparently the WWF and others have complained but judging from the reaction
    I heard from friends, most people have found the advert highly entertaining.
    The point is, as far as the car goes, there is no revenge. Pedestrian and
    cyclist are always the losers.
    <BR>

    <BR>
    ps: For all its obsession with the motor car, for years Italy had the
    highest petrol prices in Europe - tourists were given discount coupons - and
    even today Italian trains are amazingly cheap. And road deaths are lower
    than in France.

  <LI>{Gough, Philip G, Sep 2000}
    The usual advice for SA hub is to have some just discernable play feelable
    at the rim.  If you don't have some play the bearing can run tight.  A
    little play also allows for some tolerance to the axle being slightly out of
    true, i.e. a shade bent.  If the axle is bent signigicantly no amount of
    adjustment will get the left hand cone adjusted correctly - it will always
    be too tight or too loose.

    Hello,
    <BR>
    I've just bought my (used) T5 brompton yesterday. Today I discovered that
    the dynamo is broken. I thought it might be an good idea to replace it with
    an battery pack with rechargeable batteries. Does anyone know about one that
    can be mounted to the rear carrier instaed of the original dynamo, without
    disturbing the folding process.Thanks for any information !

    It would be an interesting revenge if the driver spun out of control and
    killed an innocent bystander. Otherwise, drivers can sue gun holders for
    damages in civil court and file criminal chargers for damaging private
    property; the gun and its damage are evident.  The cyclists would have to
    prove the cut-off was worthy of vigilante action.
    <BR>
    As a cyclist and driver myself, I can understand both sides, and believe
    both are at fault.  Cyclists tend to ignore road rules in Philadelphia
    until recently, when stronger bicycle representation made defined bike
    lanes emphasizing a share the road policy on the caveat that cyclist obey
    the rules of the road.  Bike lanes defined the cycle space, making it
    easier for cars to define the shared areas.
    <BR>
    We now have fewer cyclists weaving in and out of traffic rather than
    staying in the bike lane, cutting red lights, going down the wrong
    direction on one way streets etc., It has substantially improved the
    cooperation between cars and bikes in Philly, since cops are not shy citing
    errant cyclists.

  <LI>{Jeff Dauvin, Sep 2000}
    I would strongly recommend the DIY route - adjusting the 5 speed is
    one thing I don't get problems with - probably something to do with
    age! Except for the rich kids everyone had hub gears when I was
    "young" so adjustment was part of the cycling life.
    <BR>
    The recommended method in the manual works. The mirror as mentioned in
    previous correspondence is useful/essential.
    <BR>
    1 - Set up as per manual.
    2 - Test by hand pressure on pedals.
    3 - The test "live". (I live on a slope which is useful for this.)
    4 - At the slightest complaint from the system STOP & adjust.
    5 - Adjust in top gear to loosen the cable. Don't forget to jiggle
    the pedals to ensure the gears change up.
    6 - Any adjustment invariably involves tightening the cable (hinted
    at in the manual) - but only a very small amount at the time.
    7 - repeat from 3.
    8 - Tighten lock nut finger tight while holding the adjuster firmly
    so as not to unadjust. (I don't normally use the lock nut until this
    point.)
    <BR>
    Normally takes 2-5 minutes - longer if I'm inpatient!

    The bottle presumably wouldn't be the problem - it's where the rear light

    Easiest way I found was to get the parts to upgrade to T spec, then you get
    the rack, built-in rear light and more stability when in parked position.

Subject: NEW RIDE NORTH DORSET ENGLAND OCTOBER 14th 2000 - Hazelbury Bryan
  <LI>{Mark West, Sep 2000}
        A number of people have suggested that there are not enough rides near
    the end of the season so here goes!
    <BR>
        I will be hosting a combined Moultoneer/Folding society ride beginning
    at my house in the village of Hazelbury Bryan near Sturminster Newton in
    North Dorset, England at around 10.30 - 11.00 a.m. on October the 14th 2000
    <BR>
        The plan is for a gentle ride of around 30 miles in all to take in a
    number of beautiful Dorsetshire villages and a longish lunch stop in
    Sherborne, one of the finest small towns in the west country. Sherborne has
    not one but TWO castles owned by Sir Walter Raleigh and lately by The Digby
    Family (by lately I mean about 350 years or so)
    <BR>
        Our return route will be via the village of Yetminster which will allow
    our train using friends to leave us and return home if they alighted here on
    their arrival (I will send out routes to get to us from local stations and
    from main centres by car to anyone who contacts me)
    <BR>
        On returning to Hazelbury we will, I Hope, be able to enjoy some tea and
    cakes in the garden (house if wet) I hope that we will be back by about
    3.30p.m. so that people can get back home at a reasonable time.
    <BR>
        Please join us if you can. we will be really pleased to see you and can
    also help with local b&b's etc if you wish to make a West Country weekend of
    it. The colours at this time of year can be really wonderful.

  <LI>{Stein Somers, Sep 2000}
    > Until you're knocked off it !
    <BR>
    I know it's off topic but I can't resist!
    <BR>
    1. A sleeping, eating or calling driver is much more likely to bump into
    a car then into a two foot wide bicycle. In a car, you are always
    exposed to bombardments of fast cars and giant trucks; on a bicycle you
    can avoid those roads, or at least stay at their edge. The car's shell
    offers protection against minor crashes, but increase the target for
    major ones.
    <BR>
    2. When you crash into something by your own mistake, speed is not
    important.  The energy splashing through your body is, and it happens to
    rise with the square of speed.  A car exhibits much greater speeds, so
    is a lot more dangerous.  The protective measures are huge, but not
    enough as we often see.  I think it's bizarre how, outside of sports,
    drivers have only recently begun wearing helmets, and still only partial
    ones (in the form of air bags).
    <BR>
    If you ride defensively on a safe bicycle, like you would drive your
    expensive car, I seriously doubt riding is more dangerous then driving.
    You can't know from statistics, because these throw in kids, sports and
    risky leisure activities among the cyclists, whereas drivers are limited
    to licensed grown-ups (at least physically) and mostly business use.

    If I was doing so I would mount it on the right hand side of the
    front wheel. I would also set it to run on the rim. If it slips in
    heavy rain a gentle application of the brake will keep it going and
    make you more able to stop the bike quickly if needed.

Subject: Taiwan-made Bromptons
  <LI>{telomsha, Sep 2000}
    I'm a newcomer to this list and not even yet an owner of a folding bike, (and
    only  started riding a bike on holiday  in the last year- after.......hey near
    enough  40 years). Most of the  posts i've been reading on this group  are over
    my head in their level of technicality. So hope you all can tolerate my naive
    contribution and enquiry.
    <BR>
    I live in Hong Kong and am looking to buy a Brompton. Naturally the only ones
    available are Taiwan-made. Having done  some research on the models and options
    as described in  the UK catalogue and on various websites, I was looking for an
    L5. However  the Bromptons I've been able find in a couple of bikeshops here,
    seem to be 'composites'. Eg 3 gear models  seem to come only with rear carrier.
    The 5-gear models  also only available with rear carrier and (front-only!?)
    dynamo lamp. According to the catalogues the shopkeepers were able to show me
    that seems to be about it as far as options go. I cant make out if the front
    carrier bracket is  here, and from what I read it's convenience is a big plus.
    I'm trying to track down the local agent/distributor to find out more.
    So i guess i'm asking does anybody else on the list have a Taiwan model / have
    any thoughts on the matter?
    These bikes i've seen seem alot cheaper than UK/US prices, but then they  have
    locally made tyres, brakes and God knows what other substandard bits.
    As i say ideas and suggestions welcome.

    Yes, if you squirt the hood etc., and not the driver.  However, hitting the
    driver would be inevitable at some point.
    <BR>
    Nevertheless, "otherwise" mentioned below still holds, don't you
    think?  And with cyclists a minority here [ In Philly its legal for us to
    ride on the sidewalks here as we don't occupy much real estate] its easy
    for driver votes to make life miserable for all others who just want to get
    from A to B; the vocal cycle advocates here have achieved what your squirt
    guns hopes to do with less damage ... maybe it should work elsewhere?

    Someone from Japan said that they managed to fashion a carrier
    block onto a Neobike Brompton, but it involved some drilling
    into the frame.
    <BR>
    I have two of the Taiwanese Bromptons (L3T). IMVAIO they are only
    slightly lower quality than the old models of UK built Bromptons,
    but a lot lower than the recent UK built Bromptons that fixed
    some of the problems that people have been fixing themselves
    for years, i.e. the lousy brakes, tires, etc. The lack of the
    carrier block is a big minus IMVAIO, for many people. I thought
    that Neobike had added the block, but maybe that's only in the
    literature, not in reality.

Subject: RE: Revenge is sweet
  <LI>{De Clarke, Sep 2000}
    I have often been curious about practical "paybacks" that
    could be achieved when auto drivers do something egregious.
    Often have wished I had a bar-mounted wide-angle camera
    so I could take snaps and mail them to the local cops!
    <BR>
    Squirting them with noxious substances has a certain appeal
    (I would prefer essence of skunk myself, desiring to do
    emotional damage more than property damage).  But I want
    them to get a bloody ticket, dammit.
    <BR>
    ...
    <BR>
    oh dear, someone said "stay in the bike lane"...  I totally
    agree that cyclists should obey prevailing road rules -- we are
    legally vehicles, after all.  scofflaw cyclists do cause
    problems.  But you can't just "stay in the bike lane" and be
    legal (or safe).
    <BR>
    how do you make (USA) a legal left from a bike lane, for
    example? across three lanes of traffic, say? nah, the bike has
    to work its way over to the left turn lane like anyone else.
    and this is perfectly legal, and it isn't "weaving through
    traffic," as long as you use proper signalling and due caution.
    and preferably a rear-view mirror! making your left from the
    bike lane would be suicidal and against code.
    <BR>
    CA highway code (USA) is pretty clear:  the bike is a vehicle
    and has a right to use the real lane, but it must pull over (as
    with any other slower traffic) if it impedes the progress of
    vehicles which are not travelling in excess of the local speed
    limit.  the bike lane gives us a "passing lane" for this
    purpose and that is great by me, especially on high-speed
    arterial roads. in dense urban/suburban street plans I am more
    skeptical.
    <BR>
    ...
    <BR>
    I'd be a bigger believer in bike lanes if they were, locally,
    more than a white line painted on the road that gives the City
    planners an excuse for ignoring all other bike facility and
    bike safety issues :-) Oh yes, and gives the local elected
    authorities a pretext for patting themselves on the back about
    how "bike friendly" their town is -- while they dump another
    $10M of public funds into giant parking garages to encourage
    people to drive to the local shops, and another $100M into road
    widening and freeway expansion.  "We gave you a bike lane, what
    more do you want?" is what cyclists hear a lot.
    <BR>
    Excuse my bitterness, but here's the reality of bike lanes
    in my own home town (about 80K people, and completely
    car-dominated).
    <BR>
    Our bike lanes are unmaintained, especially at RR xings where
    there is significant paving damage.  Car drivers park in the
    bike lane (the city thoughtfully posts legal parking in the
    bike lane space, which reduces the working width of the lane to
    under 3ft, and to zero if someone opens the driver's door).
    <BR>
    Drivers also use the bike lane for an illegal passing lane;
    cops use it to pull over drivers for a discussion/ticket;
    pedestrians and skateboarders use it as an extension of the
    sidewalk; the City uses it to store construction materials
    during road work; large storm drain grilles, utility covers,
    and other pointy dangerous works-dept stuff are all installed
    in the "bike lane" (out of the way of the cars, natch).  The
    street sweepers sweep all the broken glass and metal scraps
    into the bike lane (where it "doesn't matter").
    <BR>
    And of course the "bike lane" officially turns into a right
    turn lane for cars at every intersection; stay in the "bike
    lane" and you are blocking motorists turning right, or worse:
    racing them to the intersection.
    <BR>
    I'm glad -- no, sincerely I am -- that better bike lane
    enforcement has helped somewhat in Philly [I *bet* the cops
    there are not shy about citing cyclists; from what I hear,
    they're not shy about bashing heads either <grin>]. But on the
    whole, segregating cyclists from car traffic doesn't work as
    well (for me) as slowing the cars down and changing the car-
    centered urban design model.
    <BR>
    "Stay in your bike lane" just isn't safe, legal, or feasible a
    lot of the time (around here).  And given the inferior quality
    of the bike lane compared to the car roadway, it reads (to my
    irritable eye) like "stay in your ghetto" or "stay on your
    reservation" -- separate, but damn well not equal.  Harumph.
    Maybe the bike lanes in Philly are beautifully maintained, and
    cars really do get ticketed for violating the bike lane, and so
    forth -- but that ain't how it is here. Here the so-called
    "bike lane" is just spare bit of paving that bikes are allowed
    to use only as long as no one more important wants it.  Feh.
    <BR>
    hope it's better elsewhere.
    <BR>
    sorry, forgive the rant -- either my buttons are more easily
    pushed lately or it's just a coincidence that several recent
    posts have been pushing 'em :-)  I acknowledge that I'm
    only getting us further off topic...
    <BR>
    on a brighter note, one of my faculty members here just
    told me that he got a B as a gift and has fallen in love
    with it, taking it all over the Bay Area.  his wife just
    got one for herself.  so 2 more B riders in my town!

    For how bikes lanes should be, go to Denmark where they are painted blue at
    road junctions. Motorists have to give way to cyclists. No-one breaks the
    law because in the event of an accident - even if a cyclist is proved to be
    drunk and is riding without lights - the driver is still held liable. Unfair
    on drivers? Not really. They just take more care at junctions.
    <BR>
    The 'revenge' thread is childish and irresponsible. Road rage is about as
    irrational, unpredictable and potentially violent as anything one sees in
    public. However badly a driver behaves, it is immensely foolish to try
    anything in revenge, sweet (and justified) though that may be.

    I have often been curious about practical "paybacks" that
    could be achieved when auto drivers do something egregious.
    Often have wished I had a bar-mounted wide-angle camera
    so I could take snaps and mail them to the local cops!
    <BR>
    Squirting them with noxious substances has a certain appeal
    (I would prefer essence of skunk myself, desiring to do
    emotional damage more than property damage).  But I want
    them to get a bloody ticket, dammit.
    <BR>
    ...
    <BR>
    oh dear, someone said "stay in the bike lane"...  I totally
    agree that cyclists should obey prevailing road rules -- we are
    legally vehicles, after all.  scofflaw cyclists do cause
    problems.  But you can't just "stay in the bike lane" and be
    legal (or safe).
    <BR>
    how do you make (USA) a legal left from a bike lane, for
    example? across three lanes of traffic, say? nah, the bike has
    to work its way over to the left turn lane like anyone else.
    and this is perfectly legal, and it isn't "weaving through
    traffic," as long as you use proper signalling and due caution.
    and preferably a rear-view mirror! making your left from the
    bike lane would be suicidal and against code.
    <BR>
    CA highway code (USA) is pretty clear:  the bike is a vehicle
    and has a right to use the real lane, but it must pull over (as
    with any other slower traffic) if it impedes the progress of
    vehicles which are not travelling in excess of the local speed
    limit.  the bike lane gives us a "passing lane" for this
    purpose and that is great by me, especially on high-speed
    arterial roads. in dense urban/suburban street plans I am more
    skeptical.
    <BR>
    ...
    <BR>
    I'd be a bigger believer in bike lanes if they were, locally,
    more than a white line painted on the road that gives the City
    planners an excuse for ignoring all other bike facility and
    bike safety issues :-) Oh yes, and gives the local elected
    authorities a pretext for patting themselves on the back about
    how "bike friendly" their town is -- while they dump another
    $10M of public funds into giant parking garages to encourage
    people to drive to the local shops, and another $100M into road
    widening and freeway expansion.  "We gave you a bike lane, what
    more do you want?" is what cyclists hear a lot.
    <BR>
    Excuse my bitterness, but here's the reality of bike lanes
    in my own home town (about 80K people, and completely
    car-dominated).
    <BR>
    Our bike lanes are unmaintained, especially at RR xings where
    there is significant paving damage.  Car drivers park in the
    bike lane (the city thoughtfully posts legal parking in the
    bike lane space, which reduces the working width of the lane to
    under 3ft, and to zero if someone opens the driver's door).
    <BR>
    Drivers also use the bike lane for an illegal passing lane;
    cops use it to pull over drivers for a discussion/ticket;
    pedestrians and skateboarders use it as an extension of the
    sidewalk; the City uses it to store construction materials
    during road work; large storm drain grilles, utility covers,
    and other pointy dangerous works-dept stuff are all installed
    in the "bike lane" (out of the way of the cars, natch).  The
    street sweepers sweep all the broken glass and metal scraps
    into the bike lane (where it "doesn't matter").
    <BR>
    And of course the "bike lane" officially turns into a right
    turn lane for cars at every intersection; stay in the "bike
    lane" and you are blocking motorists turning right, or worse:
    racing them to the intersection.
    <BR>
    I'm glad -- no, sincerely I am -- that better bike lane
    enforcement has helped somewhat in Philly [I *bet* the cops
    there are not shy about citing cyclists; from what I hear,
    they're not shy about bashing heads either <grin>]. But on the
    whole, segregating cyclists from car traffic doesn't work as
    well (for me) as slowing the cars down and changing the car-
    centered urban design model.
    <BR>
    "Stay in your bike lane" just isn't safe, legal, or feasible a
    lot of the time (around here).  And given the inferior quality
    of the bike lane compared to the car roadway, it reads (to my
    irritable eye) like "stay in your ghetto" or "stay on your
    reservation" -- separate, but damn well not equal.  Harumph.
    Maybe the bike lanes in Philly are beautifully maintained, and
    cars really do get ticketed for violating the bike lane, and so
    forth -- but that ain't how it is here. Here the so-called
    "bike lane" is just spare bit of paving that bikes are allowed
    to use only as long as no one more important wants it.  Feh.
    <BR>
    hope it's better elsewhere.
    <BR>
    sorry, forgive the rant -- either my buttons are more easily
    pushed lately or it's just a coincidence that several recent
    posts have been pushing 'em :-)  I acknowledge that I'm
    only getting us further off topic...
    <BR>
    on a brighter note, one of my faculty members here just
    told me that he got a B as a gift and has fallen in love
    with it, taking it all over the Bay Area.  his wife just
    got one for herself.  so 2 more B riders in my town!

    Philly has come from the pit for cyclist to a relatively good stance, for a

    Only when freewheeling? It sounds more like the whole inside mechanism having enough play to collide with the hubs shell. As this mechanism has pawls on the outside to lock into the shells inside it would have significantly less play with torque applied.

    Wonderful web sites and a good read, but not being privy to how Failure
    Analysis made these calculations [they are a well respected accident
    investigative business], one issue is very strange in these statistics: if
    LIVING has a fatality rate of 1.53, how can the fatality rate be less for
    anything else?
    <BR>
    It would seem LIVING provides the baseline fatality, and everything else
    modifies it, i.e.,
    <BR>
    LIVING + Cycling
    Living + Skydiving
    <BR>
    etc.,
    <BR>
    <BR>
    In data I previously posted for comparing cycling to auto deaths in 1998,
    the ratio is nearly 768:31,000 or ~ 1:40, in this data the ratio is much
    smaller, to the tune of .26:.47 or ~ 1:2.
    <BR>
    Unlike a statistical manipulation that this data has undergone, the numbers
    I referred to earlier are raw data.

    A clear point and well said, a good rant!  In the end the bike lane isn't
    want makes it better for bikes in Philly, its the bicycle advocacy group;
    your critique is sound, I believe it to be problem as you state, it was
    here too!  A bike lane is just a sign, the real solution is a vocal group
    of bike enthusiasts willing to solve the issues you pose, enforce the
    rules, and make sure the cyclists get a fair share.  There are a myriad
    side issues raised with each solution posed, so someone has to be there to
    smoothen the ripples from waves any action creates.
    <BR>
    Laws are useless unless they're enforced and respected, so has been our
    recent problem with police abuse; but exposing and fixing it we did; the
    same goes for bike rights and rules.  It'll be quiet for the meantime, but
    when it rears it ugly head again, someone has to be there to set it right.

Subject: safer than living?
  <LI>{De Clarke, Sep 2000}
    there's a real statistical nightmare in fatality stats
    for transport, because of the "units" problem -- fatalities
    per mile?  per hour?  per trip?
    <BR>
    and then, is it person miles or vehicle miles?  air travel
    can be "safe" or "dangerous" depending on the units!
    <BR>
    there's the known fact that owning a car encourages people
    to drive further -- i.e. because they have it, they use it.
    <BR>
    and that people who are committed to the car lifestyle will
    choose to live further from work, stores, etc -- whereas a
    committed velocipedestrian will deliberately choose to live
    closer to essential stuff.  the bike rider will achieve basic
    life goals while putting in fewer miles, so lifetime risk is
    skewed even if you figure fatalities per mile... it has been
    said that regardless of mode, people spend about the same
    amount of time commuting, shopping, whatever, so maybe per-hour
    is the meaningful estimate.  I dunno.
    <BR>
    in other words, it's a mess.  good luck figuring it out :-)

    I think it's valuable to check the setting by approaching the setting gear
    position from all possible ways. If say the setting gear is speed 2, then
    select 2 from 1 then check. Then select 2 from 3 and re-check. The two
    checks will be different but both should be within the correct range.

    No, not really. You'd know how good a dynamo system is after you've had one

    you don't want them to. Not a problem with the dynamo.

    I rarely use public transport but as an example a 180 mile journey...
    <BR>
    Car:
    <BR>
    Convenient, door to door, stop when I like, choose a route I like etc. Cost
    &pound;20
    <BR>
    Train:
    <BR>
    Inconvenient - only available at certain times of the day and on certain
    days. Stops a few times, have to change trains (with all that luggage) once
    or possibly twice. While waiting for connecting trains, the time wasted
    makes the whole journey time comparable with going by car, can't control
    your own environment (often too cold) and costs &pound;35. For me, a realistic
    cost would be &pound;10 - cheaper than by car for the inconvenience of the system.

    It costs me nothing to park at home or at my parents' house. I choose not to

Subject: risks of cycling?
  <LI>{De Clarke, Sep 2000}
    afterthought: I think the "living" risk is some sort of average
    of all the risks, or of an "average lifestyle" or something
    like that.
    <BR>
    meaning -- if you did nothing, ever, but ummm water ski, 24 hrs
    a day, that would be less dangerous than ordinary living which
    includes eating (risk of choking on food) breathing (risk of
    cancer, emphysema, etc), walking (risk of falling down),
    talking (risk of saying something that upsets someone and
    getting a fatal punch in the nose?), etc.
    <BR>
    so it's correct that we have to *add* any risk onto the general
    risk of living...  of course living is infinitely risky,
    because everyone who has ever done it has eventually died :-)
    <BR>
    I think the real point of the actuarial table is that cycling
    *adds* less risk to your life than water skiing, snowmobiling,
    etc.  And less than driving.  per hour, anyway.
    <BR>
    auto fatalities are so high in the us compared to bike
    fatalities because very few people spend many hours on bikes,
    whereas millions of people spend millions of hours in cars (ho
    hum).  the big raw numbers show that cars are a major killer.
    but the fatalities *per hour* show driving or riding in cars as
    only twice as risky as biking... in theory, if everyone biked
    exactly the same number of hours that they drove, there would
    only be 2x as many fatalities for cars as there are for bikes.
    <BR>
    I think the numbers game breaks down at this speculative
    point, however, because one of the reasons for car fatalities
    is too many cars.  if people drove less and biked more, there
    would be fewer fatalities all round! so *all* fatalities would
    decline.  note the finding from the WHO that if cars were
    completely separate from bikes (that apartheid I was just
    complaining about) the bike would be 500x safer, not 2x
    safer...
    <BR>
    One thing that is quite useless about this actuarial table --
    it does not tot up the risk you pose to *others* by doing
    activity X.  What risk are you adding to a bystander's life
    as you snowmobile, etc?  I'd guess the passenger car rates
    pretty high on that scale as there are more bystanders on
    the streets than out on a lake or a snowmobile track.
    <BR>
    Brompton cyclists, of course, run a higher risk than most
    of Dreaded Folder Finger Pinch, but it's not fatal
    (fortunately!)
    <BR>
    ...
    <BR>
    oh, we gotta get off this safety topic...  I'm still looking
    for the perfect folding lightweight trailer for a B.  how about
    the Ruxxack hand cart, with some kind of simple hitch, has
    anyone considered this?   it's very light and folds flatter
    than you would believe.

    I've got a week's holiday at Halloween and I've booked a ticket to Miami.
    Normally I'd hire a car and drive north. However it occurs to me that I

    Question:
    A nice part of the US where cycling should be fun at the end of October,
    where the roads aren't crowded or dangerous and where I can find interesting
    towns, villages or hamlets to stop at regular intervals?
    Hills aren't really a problem; I made a policy decision years ago that I
    would never sweat my way up a hill - and the B's the easiest of bikes to

    I'm sure there's a good reason.  However, that's the problem with massaging
    the numbers with many denominators and multipliers: fatalities/million
    hours, interpreting it becomes more abstract; the raw data is easier to
    communicate and interpret.
    <BR>
    The data is strange and thus, rather than speculate, the ORIGINAL authors
    should explain what these numbers mean; sadly, this risk chart has been

    As this seems to reflect my own attitude, would it follow  that a 3-gear model

Subject: Safety Bicycle vs. Car
  <LI>{Mindak Dietmar, Sep 2000}
    All the stats quoted here miss the issue. You cannot compare "exposure
    hours" to come to conclude that bike travel is much safer than going by car.
    If the fatalities per miles travelled are compared I'm sure that the car is
    one of the safest forms of transport, with the bicycle trailing far behind.
    I have, however, not researched the subject and cannot back up this "gut
    feeling" with hard data.

    Unfortunately you have interpreted the stats incorrectly - you are
    using unfactorised numbers (that is your "denominator"). The
    important issue is - What is your chance of being killed for each
    mile you travel?
    <BR>
    If you knew the number of bikes & cars in the population & the number
    of miles they travel per annum then did the comparison you would
    probably would never use a bike again!
    <BR>
    Anyone got the figures?
    <BR>
    Number of bikes in the population say = A
    Average number of miles they travel per annum = B
    Number of cars in the population = C
    Average number of miles they travel per annum = D
    <BR>
    	(C x D)/(A x B) = the risk factor
    <BR>
    eg A=1 B=10 C=10 D=100
    	(10 x 100)/(1 x 10) = 1000/10 = 100
    Therefore you would be 100 times more likely to be killed on your
    bike than car.
    <BR>
    Anyone got any figures?!

    I can vouch for this - BUT - all the improvements end at the most
    dangerous points i.e where roads narrow, in the middle of a busy
    road or at a roundabout. Near here some traffic calming has taken
    place by put edge of road obstructions in but NO cycle slot so the
    cyclist has to join in, with unfavourable odds, to get through the
    gap with traffic in both directions.

Subject: RE: S-A hub - gear lchange linkage adjustment
  <LI>{Mindak Dietmar, Sep 2000}
    On my bike (1997 T5; one cable gearchange) the adjustment works best if
    *not* set up as per manual. As was pointed out by another listmember the red
    mark on the indicator rod needs to be fully visible (just outside) the rear
    axle when adjusting in second gear. Going by the manual results in sudden
    gearchanges under load; something which cannot be too beneficial for the

    I think it's valuable to check the setting by approaching the setting gear
    position from all possible ways. If say the setting gear is speed 2, then
    select 2 from 1 then check. Then select 2 from 3 and re-check. The two
    checks will be different but both should be within the correct range.

    Set it up by the manual - you can't go by experience from 1 bike &
    extrapolate!! There are manufacturing differences. Once you know what
    setting your bike needs use that - as in Willi's case.

    Fully agree. But bear in mind that when the adjustment according to manual
    does not seem to work there might be a position sligtly off the recommended
    one that cures the problem. So if you have problems, give it a try.

Subject: RE: S-A hub - gear change linkage adjustment
  <LI>{Gough, Philip G, Sep 2000}
    I've always (well for 20 years) been a 5 speed hub fan, but last night I
    swapped the 5 speed hub for a spare 3 speed wheel as the former needs  a
    strip down having 'lost' 2nd and 4th gears.  After gettng everything back
    on, I just just whizzed the little adjusting nut until the cable was a bit
    slack in top gear and away it went, all three gears functioning.  Clearly a
    price is paid for the occasional ease of getting up those underpass ramps in
    super low or flying down hill in super top.  Still think the old 2 cable hub
    was easier to deal with on the Brompton

    <BR>
    Yes! The cycle lanes often stop exactly where you start needing them! I
    spoke to our local Council Cycling Officer about this (he rides a
    bike!) and he agreed but says his hands are tied by highways. Where
    it's too narrow they refuse to take away lanes or pedestrian areas. But
    he showed me places where they have used some ingenious ways to make it
    work, and their own targets suggest they have to do much more.

    Again no hard data, but I read lately that mile-for-mile a cyclist in the UK

    My nearly seven year old daughter can ride me Brompton, but she is VERY large
    for her age. And even so she finds the brakes very hard to reach.
    <BR>
    She's been riding confidently for nearly two years now (on her own bike) and
    once she'd got the hang of pedalling with stabilisers I got her riding without
    in just one week. I got her to ride down a gentle slope, first with me
    supporting, and later on her own. She gradually got further and further
    without having to stop and put her feet down, and then it clicked.
    <BR>
    You might be OK with a Brompton as long as the seat is all the way down and
    the handlebars are adjusted to be lower (swung back).  But make sure the
    brakes can be reached as these are important for confidence!
    <BR>
    BTW When my daughter hits the switch to bring the Zap online it leaps
    forwards! Power to weight is very important. :-)

    1. I wouldn't like major injuries either - BTW, in Belgium, I believe
    people dying one month after an accident are not considered killed on
    the road.
    <BR>
    2. MY chance, so probably not an average over all people on a bicycle.
    Divide the group into categories and show me how the chance varies among
    them.  If it varies little, I'll accept the average.
    <BR>
    3. So I don't care much for an average for each mile travelled (for
    utilitarian travels, this should be miles covered).  Noone is devoted to
    one type of vehicle for all miles travelled.  Divide the travels into
    categories and see how the chance varies among them.  I will alter the
    route or vehicle used for the dangerous travels, not all of them.
    <BR>
    Of course, this becomes terribly complicated and is probably a waste of
    time anyway.

Subject: Learning to ride, using a B
  <LI>{Ian Charles, Sep 2000}
    Many thanks for the observations. In light of what you say (child rather
    small), I'll try and find her a suitable conventional bike on which to
    learn. But it isn't that easy these days - most children's bikes I see now
    are scaled down ersatz-MTB's with 'full suspension' (really useful for a
    child's bike, I don't think) and a confusingly and unnecessarily large array
    of derailleur. Reluctant to buy used bike from boot sale as I've probably
    encouraged someone to continue stealing (or am I being too cynical?)

    My nearly seven year old daughter can ride me Brompton, but she is VERY
    large
    for her age. And even so she finds the brakes very hard to reach.
    <BR>
    She's been riding confidently for nearly two years now (on her own bike) and
    once she'd got the hang of pedalling with stabilisers I got her riding
    without
    in just one week. I got her to ride down a gentle slope, first with me
    supporting, and later on her own. She gradually got further and further
    without having to stop and put her feet down, and then it clicked.
    <BR>
    You might be OK with a Brompton as long as the seat is all the way down and
    the handlebars are adjusted to be lower (swung back).  But make sure the
    brakes can be reached as these are important for confidence!
    <BR>
    BTW When my daughter hits the switch to bring the Zap online it leaps
    forwards! Power to weight is very important. :-)

    There was a scaled down version of the mini-Moulton made by Triang, probably
    not available in Dk.

  <LI>{Bob Gelman, Sep 2000}
    Don't want to spoil your holiday, but Florida is one of the worst States for
    cycling (although VERY flat).  It is quite unsafe to cycle there compared to
    many other places.
    <BR>
    For October (presuming it doesn't snow!) and Fall in the USA, you can't beat
    New England.  There are Youth Hostels there too!

    One fine day in March 2000. There have been smaller improvements along

    I have an S-A sprinter leaflet. The key steps in gear adjustment are:
    <BR>
      5. Select second gear on the gear control and rotate
      the pedal crank to ensure the gear is fully engaged.
      Turn the cable adjuster until the centre of the raised boss at
      the end of the indicator rod is level with the end of the axle.
    <BR>
      6. Tighten the locknut against the adjuster.
    <BR>
      7. Select 5th gear, rotate the pedal crank, change back to
      second gear and check adjustment.
    <BR>
    Steps 1..4 are more for initial set-up than subsequent re-adjustment.
    <BR>
    My indicator rod has a narrow section painted red rather than a
    raised boss, but I assume they are equivalent indicator marks.
    I prefer to adjust so that rather more than half of the indicator
    mark is outside the axle, on the basis that it will then take
    longer for cable stretch to lead to a need for re-adjustment.
    This also makes the cable a bit tighter in first gear, which could
    help with selection of first gear, which is rarely immediate.
    <BR>
    I imagine that if the gear wheels that mesh for second gear have
    been damaged due to excessive use when adjustment is needed to
    overcome cable stretch, then having the whole of the indicator
    mark outside the axle might be useful, but not otherwise.
    <BR>
    BTW I remain sceptical about reported preferences for play in the
    bearings, particularly assuming they are ball, not roller, bearings,
    which are likely to suffer undue wear if not somewhat preloaded.
    If a hub needs play to work OK, it is probably on its last legs.
