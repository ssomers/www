I just returned from Tokyo whereby I noticed a bike shop selling
Bromptons that had a decal of the UK flag prominently displayed across

since the decal also stated such was made in England.   It looked pretty
spiffy, indeed (like the British Racing Green color model).

Sending a Brompton to Australia from California is about $200US

<H3><A NAME="Taiwan"></A>Taiwan</H3>
<EM CLASS="from">Steven M. Scharf, Jan 1998:</EM><BR>
Ever since I first saw a Brompton at the 1995 Taipei International
Bicycle Show I wanted one. In January 1998 I was back in Taipei on
business and decided to try to buy one.

<H4>Neobike</H4>
Not everyone knows that Brompton licensed a Taiwanese company
called Neobike to manufacture and sell the Brompton in Asia.
The whole story is quite complex as the founder of Neobike was
employed by another Taiwanese folding bicycle company who sent
him to the U.K. to arrange the deal. The employee quit and started
Neobike and made the deal with Brompton to manufacture the
bike in Taiwan (this is the story I heard anyway).

<H4>Price</H4>
At the time of the 1995 bike show, the Taiwanese made L3TS was
retailing for about US$300. But due to the strong dollar the
price has fallen in $US; I paid $235. The L3TS is kind of a
cross between a L3 and a T3. It includes a rear rack but no
lights. It also includes a zippered Brompton logo carry bag,
the left folding pedal, and a frame pump.

<H4>Quality</H4>
I have heard reports that the Taiwan manufactured Bromptons
are of lower quality than the English built units. This may
be true. I am having trouble adjusting the rear fender to
prevent it rubbing the rear wheel; it may be due to a lower
quality rear brake set that prevents the fender from being
high enough over the wheel. I have given up for now and
removed the fender, but I think by some cutting of plastic
under the brake set I can get it to work satisfactorily.

<H4>Neobike Office</H4>
The Neobike export office was a ten minute walk from my hotel
but they were no help. They never returned e-mail or phone
calls and when I went to the office no one was there that day.
<BR>
Neobike Office: 112 Chung Shan Road N. Section 2, 3rd Floor, Room A =
(turn left from hallway with the elevators, go to the end of the hall).
Neobike has a desk in room A.
Note that the entrance to the building's upper floors is around to the
right down an alley from the main entrance of 112 which is a bank.
Phone 2 5413253.

<H4>Taipei Retailer</H4>
Fortunately I had saved a list of Taipei bicycle shops handed
out by the Brompton people at the bike show three years earlier.
They had circled one shop that carried the Brompton (all in
Chinese characters and with no phone number). I had my hotel
look up the phone numnber of the shop. I called them (they spoke
English fortunately) and they said that they did have a Brompton
in stock. I went over there to check it out. They had only a
sickly green one in stock but they told me they could get a red
one by the next day, and they followed through with their promise.
<BR>
I picked it up on Saturday morning and took it back to my hotel.
They had the shipping box which was helpful for shipping it home
on the plane (no charge).
<BR>
Shop name: David Bicycle Company (also called 102 Bicycle Shop)
<BR>Manager: David Chen
<BR>Address: 102 Hsinyi (sometimes spelled Hsin I or Sin Yee) Road Section
<BR>Phone: 2 7066556 or 2 7000788
<BR>Directions: Exit the Ta-an MRT station, turn left (west) on Hsinyi Road
Walk about 1/2 km to #102 on a corner. I think the cross
street is Chien Kuo Road South but I am not sure.
<BR>Hours: Usually 10:30 am to 9:00 pm. Closed Tuesdays.
<BR>
You should call first to ensure that they have what you want. Call a day
or two in advance so they can get what you want, especially if you will
be staying only a short time in Taipei.

The differences between British and Taiwanese are "quality of components".
Most of the components are made in Taiwan and cheap (no no, are reasonable).
But the Sturmey Archer shifter is assembled.
And we cannot use the optional "Front carrier block".
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Paul Collins, Dec 1997:</EM><BR>
I have recently purchased a Brompton here in Hong Kong, actually
only two weeks ago.  It is of the Taiwanese assembly and so far so
good except ....
<BR>
The rubber suspension stopper has all but disintegrated after only
using it only about 5 times and has basically fallen off !!  I
would not say that I am overweight at 6'1" weighing 85 Kgs (don't
know what that is in pounds).  I have only ridden on paved roads
and concrete footpaths (not off-road).
<BR>
The dealer I purchased from is quite reputable so should have no
trouble getting a replacement of this.  However, I would not like
to think this is going to be a recurring problem.
<BR>
Is this an experienced problem with a better solution than the
standard rubber stopper ???
<BR>
On another issue, the standard brakes are rather poor.  After
leaving my mountain bike (which as excellent stopping power) this
bike would take at least 2-3 times further to stop at similar
speed.  Is it just a matter of changing to quality brake pads (and
longer) or it an issue with the antiquated side-pull brakes ??
Otherwise, is this unresolvable being related to the dynamics of
16" rims ???
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Steven M. Scharf, Feb 1998:</EM><BR>
On the Taiwanese Brompton the fender is held by an L bracket on
the bolt that holds the rear brake, and by a plastic clip that goes around
the rear of the rear rack. I think it is completely different than the UK
Brompton.
<BR>
With or without rubbing, the fender interfered with proper
operation of the rear brake. I am going to trim the fender
plastic so it doesn't interfere with the brake, then see if
it still rubs. Or I may just put a splash guard on the rear rack
(I guess your L5 doesn't have a rear rack, but the Taiwanese
L3 does), and see if that works in place of a fender.
<BR>
No doubt the Taiwanese Brompton is lower quality. The components
are all probably bottom of the line. It's difficult to tell about the frame
quality--it looks fine, but who knows what kind of steel they are using.
For my use I could not justify spending $850 or so, but at $240 it became
attractive even if I have to replace some components. If the frame breaks
then it's a different story. I only know one other person with a Taiwanese
model, and he said it was fine, but this was several years ago and I
have lost contact with him.

I believe the real problem I'm having is that the fender simply does not
properly fit under the brake; the rear brake didn't work properly until I
removed the fender. I need to trim a bit of the plastic away so
the fender can sit higher and not interfere with the brake or hit the tire.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Custfold, Feb 1998:</EM><BR>
The original and if I recall correctly Taiwan Bromptons use a 1" headseat
and correspondingly small steerer tube.
This was considered too small & flexible in the light of
service experience.  Whilst the forces on a 'bent bars are likely to be
smaller, as you can't honk up a hill, there may have been some apprehension on
modifying the steerer to give potentially greater leverage on the headset and
joints.  Brompton are very thorough in testing the components to learn of
expected fatigue life, and can usually tell you where the component
will fail when overloaded - I usually prove them right....

Funny I bought two of them in the "west". I think you just have to be

Also, I hate it when people say the Neobike's parts are lower quality I
think the quality is extremely light at this price point. All I changed
was the brake pads and hand grips.

I fit it by drilling two holes in the headset tube and fitting carrier

I have carried about 4 kg in the pannier for a year of daily use.

Brompton patents have proven defensible right
across the world, although - as is well known in the industry - the
patents do not have long to run. [...]
<BR>
The [Brompton] company probably rather regret the licensing agreement
with Neobike
as the Taiwanese company have not always been entirely honest and are not
too scrupulous about paying Royalties. The Neobike machines are strictly
NOT for sale in Europe, North America and Australia, but odd ones or twos
have found their way in.
Components are not all bad, and one or two are now fitted to new
Bromptons, but the Neobike does not have the braze-on for the front
carrier system - a major disadvantage. There's also some question marks
over the engineering quality. All-in-all, I'm happy to have bought a
Brompton, but I can see how the price of the Taiwanese bike must look
tempting.

The Neobike frames are made by that company in Taiwan. They are "genuine"
Bromptons in that they are made under license, but they are not identical to
the British frames. The construction and finish is somewhat cruder than the
British-made Bromptons, e.g. the top tube appears to be bent without a
mandrel, which causes some distortion and wrinkling on the underside of the
tube. I have also heard that the metallurgy of frame materials is less
consistent than the British product.
The Neobike Brompton weight is comparable
to a similarly-equipped English-made Brompton from several years ago, which
probably means the Neobike is heavier than the latest generation of British-
made bikes.
The component and accessory differences have already been noted on
this list. Lastly, the Brompton licensing agreement for Neobike does not
extend to North America.
Some people may bring "pirated" Taiwan-made Bromptons
into the States, but don't expect to be covered by the factory warranty.

I have a Taiwanese one and I seem to suffer the same problems as
people have with the UK ones, no more or less. It's still rather new
though.
<BR>
The components on the Taiwanese ones seem to be lower grade, i.e.
the hubs and brakes. The headset is smaller diameter. There is no
provision for the very cool Brompton front pannier (though people have
been able to fit it by improvising). These were observations by UK
Brompton owners on the last SF folder ride. I did hear once that the
frame material was not as good on the Taiwanese models, but I have
no evidence that this is true.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Steven M. Scharf, Jul 1998:</EM><BR>
I have the Taiwanese made version of the Brompton, called the L3-T
(it has the rear rack but no lights). It also comes with a nylon carrying
bag, folding pedal, and pump. In Taiwan it was US$235.
<BR>
Overall I've been satisfied but there have been a couple of problems:
<BR>
1) The rear fender interferes with the operation of the rear brake. I tried
for hours to adjust everything, but finally gave up and removed the fender.
<BR>
2) I noticed last week (after owning it for five months) that the right
pedal
was cross threaded into the crank arm. I had to order a set of Park pedal
taps (pedal threads are 9/16" x 20 tpi, not something a hardware store
has) to fix this.
<BR>
For a level ride the Brompton is fine. They're a little scary on hills
because the brakes are poor, but this is a problem on the British
ones too, and you learn to compensate. There has been a lot of
discussion of remedies to this problem but I haven't done any of them yet.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Ian R. Platt, Oct 1998:</EM><BR>
Made under license by Neobike.  This is a bit of a hybrid: it has 3
gears, no lights, but does have a rear carrier frame (a heavy-duty
wire job - not as nice as the UK version).  More crucially, they do
<EM>not</EM> have the holes in the stearing tube for the front carrier
block.  It may still be possible to fix this with a jubilee clip or
some such - I think this was mentioned in a post a while back - but
such an arrangement may not be as solid as the UK version.  The
Taiwan model has a pump, and it comes with a folding left pedal.  It
comes in more colours too!  I've seen yellow, red, blue, a lovely
racing green, and they have more union flag stickers on them than the
UK version!

[...] the Neobikes come with a lovely
shoulder bag-type bag in the standard Ford range of colour.  The bike

My Taiwan Brompton cost about $NT7000 earlier this year.
<BR>
The best way for your girlfriend to find a shop is to telephone NEOBIKE
and ask them for the name of a reseller in her area.  I think NEOBIKE will
refer her first to the local distributor. My friends made a couple of phone
calls for
me when I was there.  They gave me written instructions for a taxi to take
me
to the shop.  Great entertainment in the bike shop as we mutually gestured
about
bike, colour, accessories, etc.  Thankfully the owners grandson was present
to
speak a little school learnt English.  Ah the joys of being an ugly western
traveller
with no local language.
<BR>
FWIW, The Taiwan Brompton is 3speed with rear carrier (but no front block) &
comes with a
carry bag and a seat bag to take the folded carry bag.  I had a little
problem with quality,
so I suggest you get your girlfriend to take the bike out of the cardboard
box and ride a little
before she leaves the shop - listening for rattles, rubbing, stiffness, etc.
<BR>
The best entertainment was with the Hilton hotel door staff.  They were all
impressed
by the bike, that it was Taiwanese made and wanted to know the cost.  Never
a
problem to fold it and take it up to my room.  Drivers in Tapei still expect
to see cycles and
Motor cycles, so I neve had any trouble with them - even when riding late at
night.
<BR>
My Brompton came from a little shop down near the river in Tapei.  However,
I first saw them in the sports department of the AsiaWorld department
store right opposite the main train station & MRT station where they were
on sale for about $NT8500.

I have had a Neobike Brompton for over four years, in fact I've have two.
One is in England (my home) and the other is in Hong Kong where I work for
most of the year.
<BR>
Both are in black, with three-speed Sturmey Archer hub hears, rear rack
fitted, mudguards, folding left-hand pedal included and were a lot cheaper
to buy than in England. Though I've seen mention of build quality problems,
I've never had a problem with either of them. The one in Hong Kong gets the
most use, and I've seen quite a few other people using them. One odd thing
is that in Hong Kong, it's virtually immpossible to get spare tyres! The
only 16 inch ones are the smaller, fatter type usually seen on Asian built
bikes like Dahon, etc. Anyway, it's no problem in the UK and I get
replacements from there when needed.
<BR>
There are quite a few shops selling Neobike Bromptons, and the price varies
depending on the location of the shop, the nationality of the person asking
the price, and whether you look like you are a tourist or living here. The
place in Hong Kong where I got my two bikes say they can send them if
necessary.
<BR>
The price last Saturday (when I asked) is HK$3800 each including the freight
charge and insurance to England. Usually for payment from overseas you need
to go to a bank and buy a draft which you send to the shop.
<BR>
The person to contact is Wong Lai Mui on fax 852  (for Hong Kong) then 2625
4030 or you can email me direct and I will ask any questions you have.
<BR>
By the way, I did try direct from Taiwan, before buying my second Brompton.
However the hassles were just to much. Hardly anyone spoke English there,
and no one really wanted to send out one-off orders. However I guess the
prices would be cheaper, if you can do it!
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Steven M. Scharf, Feb 2000:</EM><BR>
First of all, there are no Bromptons made in China.
Neobike makes Bromptons under license in Taiwan. They
have one model, the L3A which is better than the UK
Brompton, at least in terms of components, and one model
the L3B which is not as good as the UK Brompton. The brakes
on the L3B stop just as poorly as the brakes on the UK Bromptons,
on the L3A there are V-Brakes.
<BR>
See:
<BR><A HREF="http://www.neobike.com/l3a.html">http://www.neobike.com/l3a.html</A>
<BR><A HREF="http://www.neobike.com/l3b.html">http://www.neobike.com/l3b.html</A>
<BR>
I don't know if the L3A is actually in production
as the bike shop in Taipei that carries Bromptons
said that they couldn't get them.
<BR>
I have two of the L3Bs, the last one I purchased
in Taiwan in January 2000 for about $255 with left
folding pedal and carrying bag. The first one was a
little less due to the currency exchange rates. These
have been fine so far.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Stephen Casey, Feb 2000:</EM><BR>
I'm an owner of both the English T3
and the Taiwanese (actually I have two) L3B (it is more a T3 like
version-since it has the touring rack).  And I live in SF.  You are
welcome to look at the two side by side and "kick the tires" so to
speak.  I've been using the one Neobike regularly with the CalTrain
between Hillsdale/San Mateo and Potrero Hill.  Let's face it, there are
some pretty awful design flaws and I could go on about those-most
notably the brakes.  Probably a little inferior manufacturing, but the
English one is not that much better.  The english version is based on a
good idea-which by the way the taiwanese version is identical here-but
that's about it.  There is not much technical superiority of the english
version over the taiwanese version, anyone who tells you otherwise is
fooling everyone.  Both could be a lot better for certain, but let's not
kid ourselvelves that one is FAR superior to the other-they both could
stand many technical advancements.
<BR>
Oops . . . I've said too much.  Sorry, I get a little peeved when people
start aluding that the english Brompton is some sort of standard for
excellence in folding bike-speak.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Steven M. Scharf, Feb 2000:</EM><BR>
I agree with all of this. The Neobike is only slightly inferior to the UK
made unit. Neither is
made with wonderful components. However with the UK model you get a lot of
expertise from
Channell in terms of upgrades of stuff like brakes and gearing, both of
which are not
very good for this area the way the bike comes from the factory. Also the
Neobike
doesn't support the front luggage system.
<BR>
There are many superior folding bikes in terms of components, durability,
and ridability, such as the Montague, the Gaerlan, and even some of
the Dahons, but these others don't fold as small or as fast as the
Brompton, which after all is what attracts people to the Brompton
in the first place.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Andras Toth, Feb 2000:</EM><BR>
You might be interested to hear what happened when, reading the ongoing
discussion about Neobikes I sent a buyer enquiry to them via Internet out
of pure curiosity. Since I am in France for six months I indicated my
postal address here.
Actually, Neobike forwarded my request to Brompton UK, who answered that
Neobike are only entitled to sell their products in the Far East.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">PETE ALEX, Feb 2000:</EM><BR>
I have had two of the Taiwan built Bromptons,
and have used them for years, one in Hong Kong, the other in the UK (I
commute between the two places on a regular basis). No problems, the gearing
is Sturmy Archer from the UK, the back carrier is better, the extras that
cost more on the UK model, are standard fitting on the Taiwan model. There
is even a wide choice of colours available, immediately from stock. Okay,
there is not provision for the front carrier/bag, but with a price of less
than half the UK model, I can handle that. Many quality bicycles are made in
Taiwan, as are most components, it's just a fact that's not shouted out
loudly by sales assistants. On an organised Brompton ride in south London
last year, most other Bromtoneers couldn't see any real difference.
<BR>
Finally, talking about prices. It seems to me that Bromptons, and indeed
many other products in the west, and especially overpriced. Whether it is
the intention of the manufacturer and/or supplier. Perhaps it's taxes
applied by governments. But whatever it is, it seems that the consumer, that
is you and I are the ones who suffer. The rate of pay for a factory worker
in Taiwan is about the same as that of one in the UK. Certainly they don't
pay as much in income tax, other taxes are less too. Even so, they have the
(Taiwanese) Bromton for sale on the streets at around US$250, it was more
before, but exchange rates have changed somewhat quite recently.
<BR>
And one more finally! Talking about development. I would say Neobike have
done their fair share of that. Was it not them that developed the
light-weight aluminium Brompton that was on show in Japan a year ago?

<H2><A NAME="37"></A>Is there some advantage over getting direct from UK vs from Channell in California?</H2>
<UL>
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Jerry Kaidor, Aug 1999:</EM><BR>
Just price.  The things are cheaper in the UK.  Also, I effectively
got free shipping, because I had a checked baggage right to spare.  And,
since I didn't buy much else on that trip, I got them home duty-free!
I even got the VAT returned, since I took them out of Europe.
<BR>
Whereas Channell has to pay for shipping and duty.  Then he needs to
take some profit on his shipping and duty.  And charge me sales tax on
top of that!  This is offset to some extant by his being local and
being able to supply warrantee service.  If my Bromptons die, I'll
need to ship them back to the U.K.
<BR>
The second "advantage" was purely personal and psychological.  My wife
had dragged me along on this monumentally boring transatlantic cruise.

<LI><EM CLASS="from">David Henshaw, Apr 98:</EM><BR>
Generally, Bromptons are
quite rare second-hand, and there's little point in buying one
anyway. The second-hand price tends to mirror the new price without
adjustment for inflation. If you paid &pound;300 a few years ago, you
will get &pound;300 now. If you pay &pound;500 today, you'll get &pound;500 in a
few years, etc. Good if you're selling, but bad news if you are
buying - the new bikes are much lighter than even last year's
examples.
Having said that, I met someone recently who found two new Bromptons
in the local free-paper for &pound;350 the pair. A real bargain. When he
arrived, the phone was ringing continuously.
<BR>
Then there's the (true) story of the boss who bought one for his
plane, but didn't like it, so asked his secretary to sell it. She put
the brand-new bike in the local paper for &pound;25...
<BR>
Just a personal view - don't waste &pound;500 on a 'T' type. Go for the
cheapest, lightest bike... a &pound;390 L3, but add the front carrier
block, and buy some luggage and Primo tyres when you can afford it.
You will love you L3 much more, and it'll keep its value better than
a 'T'.

<EM CLASS="from">Pierre-Philippe Coupard, Oct 2003:</EM><BR>
On top of my hear, look for these:
<UL>
<LI>"Crunchy" noise of feeling in the rear hub, or gears that don't engage
or disengage right.
<LI>slack rear triangle hinge : lift the saddle slightly so the rear
triangle's rubber block doesn't touch the frame, and push the bottom of
the saddle post sideways back and forth : you may feel something moving
slightly, but if you can see the rear triangle and the main frame
"bending" with your naked eye, that's bad.
<LI>Paint that lifts around a weld.
<LI>Hinge plates (the U-shaped aluminium thingies that hold the bike
together) bottoming out on the frame
<LI>Rust on the inside face of the hinges.
<LI>Worn/damaged saddle post clamp : the post should be locked with a
reasonable amount of force to the clamp. If you have to push like crazy,
that may not be right. Also check for lifting paint and/or rust in the area.
<LI>Bad BB or failing chainring : make sure you don't hear or feel any
clicking noise that follows the pedalling rythm when you pedal. If you
do hear something, try to pedal harder on one pedal, then the next, to
see if it doesn't come from the folding pedal.
<LI>Worn chainring/chain/sprocket : push the chain outward on the
chainring, where it's fully engaged : if the chain moves and you can see
between the chain and the teeth, you might have to change the chainring
and the chain.
<LI>Worn front hub : lift the front wheel, spin it by hand, and try to
listen to something crunchy, or feel an uneven resistance. Also see if
there's play when you rock the edge of the wheel back and forth.
<LI>Worn folding pedal : pedal on the bike and check that it doesn't feel
out of true under your left foot. Check using both sides of the platform.
<LI>Damage to the rim walls
<LI>Worn tires : not a problem in itself, but if the owner claims to use
the bike only seldom and the tires are bare to the thread, beware. Also
watch for bald patches on the rear tires, that might indicate the guy
has a habit of locking the rear wheel to brake, which in turn may
indicates abuse to the bike.
<LI>Slack brake levers : if you rock the brake levers back and forth,
there should be a little play, but excessive play, or significantly more
play on one lever than the other may indicate the owner crashed (and the
bike landed on one lever).
<LI>General condition of the bike : if the brakes aren't well adjusted, if
the pain is in good condition, if the chain looks like it hasn't seen
lubrication in a long time, if there's crud accumulating where it's not
too easy to clean ... A clean and well adjusted bike means a careful owner.
