<H3><A NAME="164"></A>Is it worse on a Brompton?</H3>
<UL>
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Chris Newport, Jul 1998:</EM><BR>
I'm still deeply in love with my L5 after 2 months of living together,
but my view of the Raleigh Records with which it is shod [before March 2000]
grows dimmer by the day.
<BR>
These wretched artefacts are averaging only 100 miles between punctures -
I've had 3 so far.  Is this typical or have I been particularly
unfortunate?  With my road bike, on which I do around 120 miles per
week, I only expect one puncture every 3 months or so.
<BR>
It would be more bearable if it weren't so physically difficult to work
with these tyres.  The strength needed in your thumbs to get them back
on the rims is more than most people possess.
<BR>
It might be entertaining for future folding bike rallies to supplement
the standard 'fastest folding time' competition with a 'fastest time to
fix a punctured Raleigh Record on the back wheel' competition.
<BR>
Is it reasonable to expect punctures at the same frequency as on a
larger tyre?
</UL>

<H3><A NAME="165"></A>Cause analysis</H3>
<UL>
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Andrew Henry, Jul 2000:</EM><BR>
Rear tyres get a lot more punctures than front ones.  To explain why, it
helps to outline the different ways that you can get a puncture:
<OL>
<LI>
The inner tube gets pinched.  This happens if there is a heavy
load on the wheel (rear wheels typically carry 60-65% of the weight
on a bicycle) and if the tyre isn't pumped up hard enough.
<BR>
I found that I got punctures a lot less often once I bought a decent
track pump, that has an accurate guage and can pump a tyre easily up
to 100psi (7 atmospheres).  When you have a nice pump, its quick and
easy to pump up your tyres, so you do it more often, and with a good
quality guage, you can tell when you have a slow puncture.  This means
that you can fix problems in the warm and dry and not by the roadside.
<BR>
The other time when inner tubes get pinched is if you snag them under
the bead of the tyre when you repair a flat.  The symptom for this is
if you get a puncture a few miles after fixing another.  For me, the
solution to this problem was to watch whilst a mechanic fixed a puncture.
Reading any number of descriptions in magazines and books didn't work
for me.
<LI>
The tyre gets punctured by a thorn, nail, piece of glass etc.  These
happen more often in the wet as the rubber of the tyre cuts more
easily.  They also happen more often on the rear tyre.  If you ride
over a nail or thorn in the road, then it will probably be lying on
its side.  This isn't a problem for the front tyre, but every so
often, the thorn gets plinged up as the front tyre passes over it,
so that when the rear tyre comes along, the thorn is pointing
straight up.  Its worth scanning the road ahead carefully to try and
avoid riding over debris.
<BR>
Tyres with a thick outer layer help for some punctures, if they
stop a thorn from penetrating the casing.  However a thinner and
more supple tyre might have been able to survive the same thorn
by flexing out of the way.  The thinner tyre will also be lighter
and roll much more smoothly.
<LI>
A patch comes loose on the inner tube.  Its best to carry a spare inner
tube with you and repair the punctured one when you get home.  This
gives the rubber solution longer to cure.  It also means that you
have a spare in case the inner tube is beyond repair (eg a puncture
near the valve), and it means you don't have to mess about with
instant patches.
<LI>
The tyre overheats when you brake heavily going down a hill.  Sometimes its
safer to ride down a hill quickly, so you lose more energy to air
resistance than riding down slowly using the brakes.  If you do
this, the rim and tyre get hot and this can increase the chance of a
puncture.
</OL>
I used to get a lot more punctures than I do now.  Keeping tyres
properly inflated, repairing them correctly, avoiding road debris
and buying decent quality tyres is what I have done to help this.

<H3><A NAME="166"></A>Airless tyres (Greentyre): a scientific analysis</H3>
<UL>
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Andrew Henry, Jul 2000:</EM><BR>
I found to my cost that , solid tyres are a good way of exchanging
problems with punctures, with problems with buckled wheels.  They also
have a lot of rolling resistance, poor grip and poor ride.  They are
_extremely_ difficult to fit.  Its easier and cheaper to learn how to use
pneumatic tyres without getting punctures.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">John Blackburn, Nov 1998:</EM><BR>
The topic of puncture-resistant tyres has arisen again. Punctures can ruin the pleasure of cycling.
Punctures jeopardise punctuality.
Here is some new information.
<OL>
<LI>
"Greentyre" is a well-known brand of polyurethane-foam tyre, but another company that makes similar tyres was the subject of an article in a recent issue of "Eureka", a UK magazine that specialises in engineering innovations and inventions.
The company is Urathon Limited and is based in Wiltshire, UK. It recently became a subsidiary of American Tire Corporation of Akron, Ohio, USA.
Urathon make tyres for wheelchairs, lawnmowers, golf buggies etc. They also make bicycle tyres but are aware of the drawbacks, which lead to higher rolling resistance.
<P>
The article explains that, in a "freewheeling" test, cycles with polyurethane tyres come to a halt at about 60% of the distance reached with normal inflatable tyres.
The reason is that hysteresis losses absorb energy. As a tyre rolls, the rubber (or plastic) in contact with the road is compressed. Energy is used when the rubber is compressed, and this energy comes from the cyclist's pedal-power. As the wheel rolls on, the rubber uncompresses, but only a part of the energy is recovered; most of the energy is lost as heat.
A polyurethane foam tyre is worse than an air-filles rubber tyre in this respect. At the moment, the grade of polyurethane is a compromise; a grade is used  which is satisfactory both for the surface of the tyre and the foam interior.
<P>
To improve matters, Urathon are developing a two-shot moulding system. The surface is moulded from a thin hard-wearing grade of plastic, then filled with a foam than can contain more air than the grade previously used.
Urathon claim that "freewheel" tests show that the improved tyre gives a figure of more than 90% (compared with the previous 60%), and further improvements may be possible.
<P>
So, what is the ideal material to fill bicycle tyres with? We need something that is light (polyurethane tyres are currently slightly heavier than normal tyres), and easily balanced (current moulding techniques have difficulty in getting an even density of foam at all parts of the tyre, giving wheel-balancing problems). And it should be cheap.
<P>
A very good substance is AIR. It is light, cheap, and naturally distributes itself evenly throughout the tyre. Best of all, it has very small hysteresis losses; when energy is used to deform an air-filled tyre, almost all of this energy is returned when the deformation is removed. Pumping the tyres to a very high pressure gives a limited improvement - the rubber is still there, it will still be compressed, and the losses will still occur.
<P>
For best performance, you need a tyre that is mainly air and very little rubber, which is why very thin tyres are so effective in minimising the power required to propel a bicycle. When you hit a bump, the energy lost in the rubber is small if there isn't much rubber; the thickness and weight of rubber is more important than the tread pattern.
<P>
This also applies to suspension systems. Imagine you are riding a bicycle at speed "v", and the total weight of cycle plus rider is "m".
The kinetic energy stored in the moving bicycle is 0.5*m*v<SUP>2</SUP>
<P>
Suppose you hit a bump so large that the bicycle bounces into the air, and moves upwards with speed "u". The upward energy is therefore 05*m*u<SUP>2</SUP>. Where did the energy to throw the cycle in the air come from? >From the "forward" energy, which is now less than before; it is (0.5*m*v<SUP>2</SUP>)-(0.5*m*u<SUP>2</SUP>). The forward speed of the cycle had been reduced.
Gravity dictates that the cycle will come down again, and hit the ground. Is the energy returned? Unfortunately it is not - much of it was lost on heating the tyre and (in the case of a sprung frame) compressing the high-hysteresis suspension medium. The cycle is now travelling more slowly than before the bump.
<P>
So energy is lost on the way up and on the way down. It is necessary to have "damping" in a suspension system, with unavoidable energy loss, or the machine would bounce violently on contact with the ground.
<P>
An ideal arrangement would be to use lossless air suspension, and absorb the energy in a storage device such as a large spring, whose energy could later be released to help you to climb hills or get away more quickly at traffic lights. But the weight of such a device would probably negate the improvements.
In suspension systems, as with tyres, energy loss is minimised by improving the "air-to-rubber ratio". If a tennis ball were used as the suspension medium, it would lose less energy (because it is mainly air) than a solid block of polyurethane.
<LI>
There may be other approaches to the puncture-proof tyre. It occurred to
me that a long steel coil spring could be used instead of an inner tube.
The steel would have the highly elastic properties that go with low
energy loss, it would be filled with air and the outer rubber tyre would
give good road adhesion and silent running. The problem would be fitting
and removal, and assuring that the tyre could not come off in use.
<BR>
Something like this has probably been tried. And abandoned. In 100 years
of cycling, everything has been tried. But that's no reason to give up -
this is 1998, new materials exist, better design methods, computers -
it's time to try again.
<BR>
Such a "throw-away" puncture-proof wheel would suit the military. If it
worked, everyone would want it, and after a few years the world would be
piled high with useless worn-out tyres.
<LI>
The amount of energy needed to propel a bicycle seems to be about 100
watts. This is made up of:
<UL>
<LI>Rolling resistance
<LI>Air resistance
<LI>Transmission losses
</UL>
A useful example: The Raleigh Electric Bicycle has a battery-pack
containing 20 4 Ampere-Hour NiCad rechargeable cells (approx. D-size
cells). Since one cell is 1.2 volts, the total voltage is 24 volts. The
energy capacity (volts*ampere-hours) is therefore 24*4 = 96 Watt-hours.
So it is about 100 watt-hours, which means that it will deliver a power
of 100 watts for one hour. Raleigh claim that the cycle can be ridden
for 15 miles at 15 miles per hour, so you can ride it for an hour. So
the power needed is 100 watts. This is of course an approximate figure.
<P>
As a comparison, the "Gossamer Condor" man-powered aeroplane that was
pedalled 22 miles across the English Channel weighed a total of 104 kg
and required 200 watts to maintain level flight. The pilot - a
Californian racing cyclist - maintained this power for several hours.
<P>
The problem for cyclists is hills, which require extra energy. It is
very easy to calculate how much more:
If a bicycle and rider of mass "m" is lifted upwards at a vertical speed
"u", the power needed is m*g*u watts (where g=9.81 as always).
<P>
Suppose you and your bike weigh 100 kg, and are riding along at 5
metres/sec (about 11 mph) and you come to a gradient of 1:20 (upwards).
If you maintain your forward speed, then your upward speed "u" will be
5/20 = 0.25 metres/sec.
The power is therefore 100*9.81*0.25 = 245 watts. This is in addition to
the power needed to overcome rolling resistance etc.
<P>
This is a lot of power. You can see that it is a pity, when descending a
hill, to waste this power in the heating of brake-blocks. How much
better to charge up a battery, or wind a spring.
<P>
Recent postings have shown that transmission losses are very small
compared with other losses, and in any case little can be done about
them, apart from regular lubrication. Rolling resistance is about tyres
and has been considered.
<P>
So it is worth looking at air resistance. The resistance of a moving
body is:
<P>
R = k*rho*A*Cd*v<SUP>2</SUP>   (where k is a constant).
<P>
"rho" is the density of the air, about which we can do nothing, apart
from avoiding valleys.
<P>
A = the cross-sectional (frontal) area of the cyclist, as viewed from
the front. Small people benefit here.
<P>
Cd = the Coefficient of Drag. If a thin sheet of plywood is cut out to
be the same shape as the cyclist plus cycle (as seen from the front), it
would, by definition, have a Cd of 1. A useful improvement to both Cd
and to "frontal area" can be made by adopting a more aerodynamic
posture, such as using "full drop" handlebars.
<P>
v<SUP>2</SUP> means the square of the speed. At double the speed, air resistance
is bigger by (2<SUP>2</SUP>), which is 4 times bigger; at 3 times the speed it is
9 times bigger. If you ride much faster, this becomes very large indeed,
and the energy loss in tyres and transmission become unimportant.
<P>
How low a value of Cd can be achieved? Without plastic nose-cones and
pointed tails, not much (but maybe these could also be used as luggage
containers, with zips and ingenious folding handles). One might hope for
values of around 0.3 using a recumbent design. Motor-cars manage this
sort of figure. The best and most "slippery" shape is a long slim glider
fuselage, which could have a Cd of 0.05 or less.
<P>
The "square-law" speed calculation breaks down at very low speeds (by
which I mean speeds much slower than those at which aircraft fly), but
the accuracy is not too bad. At these low speeds, a correction factor
called "Reynold's Number" has to be built into the calculation. Ask any
cyclist what "Reynold's Number" is, and he will immediately reply "531".
However, that is something completely different.

Don't touch Tuffy Tape: it may well score your tube & cause a puncture.  It
is too thick: even the more recent, softer varieties (unless NY version is
much better than what reached UK).  I use Protec, a much
thinner polyurethane-based liner which seems effective: not cheap but has so
far outlasted 3 tyres.  Mike at Phoenix Cycles
info@phoenix-folders.demon.co.uk had some a few months ago.
<BR>
Slime et al do work, but should be treated as temporary fixes (you will
usually see some goo emerge when they start working: presumably why they
tend to be dayglo colours).  But they do get you home.  The goo is slippy
enough to stop a patch vulcanising so clean carefully before attempting
repairs.
<BR>
Solid/semi-solid tubes: do not even think about them.  See A to B 9 on
Easiryda tubes.
<BR>
Boring old but still valid advice: keep tyre pressures up, check for cuts &
embedded detritus, make sure brakeblocks & dynamo are adjusted OK & nothing
is rubbing where it shouldn't.  Avoid broken glass (you can usually
recognise a UK cycle route by its alternative use as impromptu bottle-bank).
</UL>

<H3><A NAME="168"></A>Tyre liners (Mr. Tuffy and allies)</H3>
<UL>
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Jane Thomas:</EM><BR>
I use "Mr Tuffy", and I've found it to be excellent. On last inspecting
my new primo tyres I found 3 cuts in the front tyre all containg glass,
and a piece of glass inside the tyre between the tyre and the liner - so
I guess thats at least 4 punctures I've avoided!
<BR>
One tip if you do decide to use this stuff - on prolonged use it can cut
into the tube where the ends overlap causing a puncture! The way round
this is to get a piece of old inner tube (2-3 inches should do) and put
this between the end of the tuffy tape and your inner tube so that the
tube is protected from the tuffy tape end.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Custfold:</EM><BR>
A solution from an
old hand seems to work - cut the sidewalls off the old Primo,
or other light casing, and put it inside the new carcase.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Rob Cope, Jul 1998:</EM><BR>
Puncture sealants work, but only really as a get you home service.
Polyurethane tyre liners help but do nothing to protect sidewalls.  Avoid
the horrid Tuffy Tapes, which still damage inner tubes long term: mine came
from Cyclecare long ago and apparently are Moulton-recommended (hence not
cheap, but more or less indestructable).  Even with this lot I still get the
occasional blowout, but then local drinkers do tend to treat cyclepaths as
impromptu bottlebanks.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Ming Dinh, Jul 1998:</EM><BR>
The Tuffy strips are made of rubber, the kevlar ones are called Spinskins
and both cut into the inner tubes, the Spinskins do so at a faster rate.  I
have only used Tuffy's and it can take from 1 1/2 to 3 years for them to
puncture the inner tubes.  I'm sure they also prevent some, but I'm not
using them now, and haven't noticed getting bothered with flats much.  Mind
you, if I had to commute through broken glass a lot, I may put them on
again.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Doug Faunt, Jul 1998:</EM><BR>
I cut Tuffy tapes to fit my Brompton tires, and was unhappy with the
smoothness of the cut, so I featherd the lap using a power sander.
The parts stick togther tight enough so that I don't think there's
wear at that point when I've looked.  This problem could be minimized
by rotating the tire with Tuffy a bit every now and then.
Lastly, I'll gladly put in a new tube every year in order to prevent
punctures at inconvenient times.  I like Tuffies, and have them on my
bikes.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Jane Thomas, Jul 1998:</EM><BR>
I cut a piece of old inner tube, and use this to protect the inner tube
proper from the ends of the tuffy tape. I renew this piece periodically,
and it certainly gets cut into by the tuffy tape. I've had no problems
with tuffy tape on my Brompton, and the only puncture I've had in recent
years has been where the inner tube failed on its seam. Hurrah for tuffy
tape.
<BR>
Having said all that, I had a disaster using a tuffy tape clone on my
Moulton. Not only did it appreciably slow things down, but it actually
abraided the inside of the tyres to such an extent that both tyres
failed. I realised something was wrong as I was cycling home to a sort
of 'thonkada thonkada' noise - on checking them I found that both tyres
had bulges in the tread. When I got them off, they were full of grey
dust, and the threads inside the tyres had been worn away in one place
allowing the tyre to start bulging. Boo for 'tuffy' tape.
<BR>
'course I don't know if the problem was the Moulton or the 'tuffy' tape -
and I'm not keen to repeat the experience, so no tape in the Moulton,
and check the tyres twice a week.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">?, Jul 1998:</EM><BR>
Has anyone mentioned in this discussion Panaracer 'Flataway' kevlar fabric
tapes? These are not hard like Tuffy tape, are thin, lighter and easier
to fit as they are self adhesive on one side which sticks to the inside
of the tyre.
As with all 'puncture proofing for pneumatic tyres, these are not
puncture proof!
It is worth saying though that when repairing the puncture I had
a few weeks ago I found that the Flataway tape had prevented a number of
minor punctures as the objects had discoloured the white tape where
they had impinged on the fabric without piercing it.
<BR>
I bought my Flataway tapes from BikeFix in London for about
&pound;12-&pound;13 each - more expensive than tuffy, but worthwhile I think.
You could probably do three Brompton wheels with two rolls.
I recently bought another Primo for the front after a short trial
some time ago with one; I was most pleased to transfer the slightly grubby tape
to the Primo as I ride around central London frequently and average
3-4 punctures per year.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Ming Dinh, Jul 1998:</EM><BR>
Tuffys can cut along the sides as well as the ends of the strips, the
resulting twin grooves around the whole length of the inner tubes makes
them unpatchable.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Rob Cope, Aug 1998:</EM><BR>
Have just come across Spin Skins on an American newsgroup.  Sound like they
may have solved some of the Tuffy Tape et al problems.
Here's the website:  <A HREF="http://www.spinskins.com/spinskins.nsf/">http://www.spinskins.com/spinskins.nsf/</A>
Before you get too excited, they're not cheap (c/$40 in US) and shortest
size made is 20" (no they cannot be cut to length).
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Dave RM Lyons, Nov 1998:</EM><BR>
Having hear a number of contributions to the list about puncture prevention I
feel compelled to de-lurk and raise the subject of Panaracer Flataway tapes.
These are a kevlar felt like tape, self adhesive on one side which stick to
the inside of the tyre.  They do not prevent punctures 100% but give you more
time to remove likely causes.
As I remember they are about 12UKP each and you need one and a half for a
Brompton - expensive but I think worthwhile.  I use these tapes on both our
Bromptons and the Birdy (which is undergoing the 16 inch rim
(Custfold)/Primo/36 spoke treatment at Bikefix as I write).  The tape is
fairly soft and there is no risk of nipping/chafing the inner tube.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Steven M. Scharf, Mar 1999:</EM><BR>
I've used Mr. Tuffy extensively on several bikes and have been
almost flat free. The acid test was a tandem ride in Russia in
1993. I did get one flat in 700 or so miles, but it was due
to a sidewall puncture IIRC. Compared to the other 15 or so
tandems on the ride, I had far fewer flats.
<BR>
Most of the problems people are having are probably due
to improper use.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Custfold, Mar 1999:</EM><BR>
It is also the hard edges which perforate a neat circumferential line that is
almost impossible to patch, on the tube.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Channell Wasson, Sep 1999:</EM><BR>
Duct tape over the exposed overlapping joint along with talc helps save
tube.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Channell Wasson, Sep 1999:</EM><BR>
I bought expensive kevlar linings. After a one year use in Primo tires I
finally had a flat.  It appeared that the kevlar had cut the tube.  The
entire kevlar liner was broken like glass at about 1 inch intervals, and
each exposed area was working hard to cut the tube.  The tube was abandoned
and Tuffy type tire liner was reinstalled with duct tape over end joint. cw
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Jane Thomas, Sep 1999:</EM><BR>
As a seasoned user of Tuffy tape, I've never had it cause a puncture - I
cut it to fit, then place a piece of old inner tube between the
overlapped cut end and the inner tube proper. I find that everything
sticks gently together preventing any movement between the parts. The
last puncture I had on my Brompton was caused by the join in the inner
tube failing.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Rob Cope, Oct 1999:</EM><BR>
Protec polyurethane liners: thinner than Mr T's.  Were distributed by
Wolber & recommended by Moulton.  Does not in my experience reduce
lifetime of inner tube.
<BR>
I *think* CycleCare & Pheonix Cycles (info@phoenix-folders.demon.co.uk)
in London still have stock.  Is/was supplied in 2 rolls sufficient for 2
700c wheels.  Trimmed to Brompton size, leaves plenty spare but not
quite enough for a 3rd 16" wheel, which is annoying:  probably
sufficient for you friend's Bickerton front wheel though.  Instructions
say to fix to inside of tyre with rubber solution, but this isn't really
necessary.
<BR>
Pricier than Mr T but near indestructible.  Won't stop sidewall
punctures but neither will any liner.

I happen to live in an area that has a huge amount of thorn - producing
weeds which are death on my tires.
For two years, I dealt with multiple flats per season,
and fear of going further than 2 miles from home.
After realizing that my bike mechanic was getting rich off of me,
I went to another fellow who guaranteed my tires for a year by doing
the following:
<OL>
<LI>heavy duty inner tubes
<LI>new, wider, heavier rim strip
(the one given with the bike shifts and is cheap)
<LI>fill the inner tubes with 'Slime' (trade mark).
Slime is a polymer that is merely squirted into the tube BEFORE
inflating it via the valve.
It coats the inside of the tube and is a self sealing agent when
punctures occur.

I ride 10 miles daily, and have had no problems.
My only regret was not to have replaced the so so tires provided

cut down punctures by sealing smaller holes from glass and thorns. Of 12
punctures since Feb94 (c8,000miles) the sealant has worked for 5 and got me
home for one other. No good for traumatic splits, lumps of metal or impacts
though !

I own among other bicycles a brompton. On the others i use special
puncture resistant tyres.. they have a PVC breaker layer... But those
are not available for a brompton. You could use SLIME TIRE SEALANT i use
it on my coaching bicle i use for coaching rowing.. I bought it at
Halfords in the netherlands. It will instantly seal most tread area
punctures up to 1/8" in tube tires and 3/16" in tubeless..
<BR>
Its green slimy stuff you put into your tyres... it works very
well...and costs almost nothing [14 guilders = +/- 4 pounds] for 2,50 ml
which is enough for 2 tyres..
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Rob Cope, Jul 1998:</EM><BR>
Yes, it works most of the time ie still subject to Murphy's law.  You
unscrew the valve core, squeeze the gunk in (with care: it's luminous &
stains!), put back the core, reflate the tyre and ride around a bit to
distribute the stuff evenly.  It doesn't block the valve (too big a hole.
BUT it only repairs rather than prevents punctures.  You will eventually get
one that overwhelms it: when you then take the tube out, you will likely
find a number of smaller holes that have been filled without fuss.
<BR>
Sorry, there is no 100% solution bar solid tyres (yuk).  Aint life tough?
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Mark Maier, Jul 1998:</EM><BR>
Just a few questions. I understand this Slime stuff will seal any hole
up to a certain size - what about the valve (this has probably been
asked before)? E.g. if I decide to change from Records to Primos I will
have to release the air in order to remove the Records. Will Slime not
seal my valve, too? After Slime sealed a puncture, will the tube be
glued to the tyre?
<BR>
If it really works that well, you will find me walking into Halfords,
soon... - BTW, do you actually mean 2.5 ml (is this a decimal comma)? Or
may I assume it's 250 ml and the comma just slipped in by accident...
<LI><EM CLASS="from">David Edge, Jul 1998:</EM><BR>
I fitted two Specialized pre-filled presta-valved tubes to a cumbersome
cycle. The first punctured after 20 miles and spewed all gunk through a
small hole. The second went 120 miles and sealed a puncture. Unfortunately,
I didn't notice and when I hit the next pothole wrote off the rim due to
low pressure. This was mildly irritating as I was off touring Germany the
next day and had an essay to write. Janette learned wheelbuilding rather
quickly that night.
<BR>
So GBP20 for the tubes, GBP20 for a new rim buys 120 miles of puncture free
cycling (apart from two punctures). I'm not convinced.
<BR>
Since then, I've discovered Continental Top Tourings for the cumbersome and
they puncture once a year at most (say 2000 miles with 120kg rider). I see
they are now available in 20", but fear that even if they were available in
16" that their relative sluggishness would be exaggerated by the small
wheel size.

[...] Some months later I got CY [ Curious Yellow an L3]serviced.
Freewheel Pimlico were
advertising a superior alternative to Slime. Essentially liquid
Teflon, that sits in your inner tubes, and heals all but the worst
punctures as they happen. The catch is that you can't really DIY- a
shop has to remove the cores of the inner tube valves and pump the
stuff in. It was something like 5UKP each.
<BR>
Since then I've had no punctures. How significant this is difficult to
tell, as I've done less than 300 miles on CY since (they're mending
the escalators at Walthamstow and Victoria, which makes it all rather
inconvenient).
<BR>
I've not seen the sealant advertised recently mind, which is a bit
worrying. Rather ominously, Trek have started selling inner tubes with
sealant included, but I worry that they'll only cover the 26in and
700c sizes; this could easily be enough to make the Freewheel service
uneconomic.

I use Slime Tire Sealant. It helps against small punctures. Today it sealed
a puncture caused by a small piece of glass. Last Tuesday it failed to seal
a larger hole cut by a standing broken bottle. Half of the slime got out.
When this happens, the tire must be cleaned properly. Otherwise the rubber
plugs won't hold.
Statistically Slime helps once in a month. It fails less than once in a
year.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Bob Gelman, Mar 1999:</EM><BR>
By "rubber plugs" I think you mean what in English is called a
"patch".  It has been my experience that if the hole is big enough so
that the slime won't work (and that's most anything bigger than a
thorn), the gooey mess gets all over the outside of the tube where the
puncture is.  It makes using a "patch" very difficult because the darn
slime just keeps on coming out.  The patch won't adhere to where the
slime is on the tube.  It makes a field repair very difficult.  Also,
slime weighs quite a bit....  After getting a golf tee (yes, golf tee!)
stuck in my rear tyre and attempting half a dozen repairs in the field,
I gave up on this stuff.  I carry a tube.  I also carry a conventional
repair kit with a tube of rubber cement.  I try to avoid using the
cement because once you open it the next time you need it it will
invariably be dried out; no matter how tight you close it.  I try to
make my repairs at home.  I have found that a large jar of Elmers Rubber
Cement (comes with a brush!) only costs $2, won't dry out, and will last
for years.  There used to be a product (from Germany?? England?) which
were very small red gelatine like capsules with glue for individual
use-once repairs.  They were cheap and worked great.  I haven't seen
them for years and years....

Puncture sealant goo (various colours & brands) will usually help you
get you home, but gets all over tube making patching a pain.  Not to be

raspberry that no one believes is from the bike), spectacularly
(fluorescent goo flying everywhere like spray string) and (of course!)

The performance of a small wheeled bike is much more critically affected by
the tyre and wheel performance - solid tyres are very hard on spokes (which
are stressed more on SWB's) and the rotating mass is much more significant -
hence the efect experienced when Primo tyres which weigh 2/3 of the weight of
OEM Records, and light tubes (as little as half the weight with the 19-349
tube) are substituted - less punctures more weight - Mr Rubin wouldn't achieve

I also have had good luck with regard to flats.  I think that inflating the

to whatever is the maximum.  On my street bikes it is 110 psi.  I'm not sure
why this might be, but my theory is that bits of glass and stickers that
might puncture the tire never get the chance to adhere to the surface.  Or
it could be that there is less surface contacting the pavement, hence less
chance of touching the bad things.  At any rate, I get far fewer punctures
now than when I used to be more careless about inflation pressure.  A good
floor pump with a pressure guage helps.  I use it before most rides.

TribolicTM - 250 mg Genuine Bulgarian Tribulus terrestris.

Commonly known as punture vine - A herb used as an European remedy for
impotence and as a stimulant that increases libido (sex drive) and
sexual
performance in men and women. It is also reported that Tribolic
(Tribulus
terrestris) is the closest and strongest all-natural herbal alternative
to
synthetic anabolic hormones.
<BR>
Medical studies showed Tribolic (Tribulus terrestris) significantly
elevates the
levels of several hormones: testosterone, luteinizing hormone(LH),
follicle
stimulating hormone(FSH) and estradiol. Further studies showed that when
taking
Tribulus terrestris in just five days testosterone levels increased by a
significant 30% or more.
<BR>
TribolicTM - Competitive Edge
<BR>
Bodybuilders and other athletes like the former Soviet union and
Bulgarian
athletes used Tribolic (Tribulus terrestris) for strength and
conditioning. U.S.
Olympic coach Dragomir Chioroslan of the American weight lifting team
gives his
approval for Tribulus terrestris.
<BR>
TribolicTM - Male Performance
<BR>
Tribulus terrestris having an effect on reproductive functions:
* An increase in spermatogenesis (formation and development of sperm)
* Improvements in the quality, mortality and survival time of sperm.
* Improves strength of erection.
<BR>
Dr. Robert Fraser, Researcher and Herbalist writes Tribulus terrestris
has no
adverse effects on the central nervous or cardiovascular systems and
that it is

The plant is called puncture vine (tribulus terrestris) and it grows

If I heeded the masses of youthful riders, who believe speed is the one

Fat aggressive tread tires are preferable because:
<OL>
<LI>they absorb more road shock,
<LI>they are much less susceptible to flats,
<LI>they have greater stability in rock and gravel,
<LI>they are easier to balance on in
near stop condition,
<LI>they have less sink in sand and/or soft mud,
<LI>for any given distance of travel, they afford slightly more exercise,
<LI>they have better start/stop traction on ice or other slick surface.

<UL>
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Mike Hessey, Sep 1998:</EM><BR>
Reduction of rolling resistance is desirable to reduce effort - speed
does not come into it for the MANY riders who prefer tyres such as the
Primo. Actually many youthful riders nowadays go for fat tyres because
they look aggressive (to use your word), and are not interested in
efficiency (probably because they don't do much cycling anyway). One
could go on to question all the argument you quote, but I'm sure other
knowledgable people on this list are going to do so! Interesting address

<LI><EM CLASS="from">Rob Cope, Sep 1998:</EM><BR>
[1] Tests show resistance to flats is more to do with the strength of
the carcass than the thickness of the rubber on top (eg in the new issue of
Bycycle which flopped onto my doormat this week).  Also, deep treads can
hold shards that smoother tyres shed, allowing the shard to penetrate deeper
on later revolutions.  I think this explains my experience of Primos vs
Records.  The Primos develop alarming numbers of small cuts & holes in the
tread, but do not puncture much.  The Records puncture more, usually from a
lump of glass that has pressed deep into the tread.
<BR>
[5] Primos on Porthmadog beach 1997 (fitted to both a Brompton & a rewheeled
Birdy) seemed to perform about as well as the low-pressure knobblies fitted
to a standard Birdy.
<BR>
[7] In theory, surely, a slick tyre works best on slick surfaces?  I remember
coming a cropper on Morcambe jetty going over a marble/glass inlaid design
with Records.  Tried this again with Primos, no problem.  But i think
snow/ice is one of those (few) times I'd leave the Brompton at home & use
something with bigger wheels.

Before 2000, there were only two serious contenders: Raleigh Records (all black,

My Schwalbes have performed superbly. I have had them fitted since late last
year, and they have done around 900Km. Grip is good, and there is almost no
sign of wear. I had my first puncture (rear of course) on Saturday, caused
by a small piece of wire. I find the rolling resistance is very nearly as
good as the Primos, and they are now my preferred tyre in this size. I

There *is* a bit more rolling resistance compared with the Primo or even

It may or may not be of interest but we have just completed surveying our
latest map (of Bradford, England) using Schwalbe Marathons instead of
Raleigh Records.
<BR>
Normally, such survey work (500 miles of riding on urban streets with
glass-strewn cycle paths and rough lanes) would produce an average of four
punctures. This has happened on every one of the past 12 maps we have done.
Raleigh Records or Primos would produce the same result, although Records
could be used with the dynamo.
<BR>
This time: no punctures.
<BR>
The tyres were pumped up near 100 psi and give good rolling resistance. They
will be on the bike for the next map survey (end of March/beginning of
April) and I will keep you informed of any incidents. This time it will be
Rotherham...
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Chris Newport, Aug 2000:</EM><BR>
I now have Schwalbes front and back.  Good roadholding, excellent
puncture resistance (until they wear through), but VERY SHORT TREAD LIFE
- and I see someone has reported the same experience in the latest A to
B magazine.
<BR>
To be fair I've only gone through 1 Schwalbe so far, and I didn't
measure its life accurately, but subjectively I reckon it must be well
under half the life of a Record.  Still, they're not that expensive and
for me the absence of punctures compared to Records or Primos outweighs
reduced lifespan.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Martin Whitfield, Aug 2000:</EM><BR>
The ones talked about [in the "Map of London" item in A to B (<A CLASS="quick" HREF="Where.html#A2B">Where can I find out more? - A to B</A>)]
are fitted to my bike and the rear has gone to a
replaceable level in about 1,000 miles of (albeit hard) riding. The front is
still OK.
<BR>
In that time I have had five punctures (the three in on day reported in A-B,
all glass fragments on rainy day), one pressure puncture front wheel falling
down one of London's deep potholes, and one glass somewhere else (Rotherham,
I think).
<BR>
Although this may sound like a lot of punctures, I reckon it is about half
that of the Records doing a similar amount of inner-city cycling. In my
opinion, the Schwalbe has less rolling resistance at high pressures, but is
quite hard on the wrists as a result.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Chris Newport, Aug 2000:</EM><BR>
That lifespan roughly equates with my experience.  I reckon I've done a
little over a thousand miles on the Schwalbes (on relatively good roads
though - Kew to the City and back).  The front one is fine of course;
it's the rear that gave up.  But in fairness to Herr Schwalbe I weigh
nearly 200 lbs so the rear wheel on my Brompton is heavily loaded - I
had to have it rebuilt to stop the spokes breaking.
<BR>
The good news is that I had no punctures in either tyre until I had to
replace the rear.  I too thought I was a tread separation victim until I
looked more closely and saw the cover grinning through the tread in
places.
<BR>
I reckon a rear tyre on my MTB typically lasts 4000-5000 miles (though
usually the tyre wall breaks down before the tread wears through).  I've
forgotten how to do the trig to calculate the effective length of a 16"
tyre compared to a 26" tyre, but I would guess it's in the region of
between 2:1 and 3:1.  And given that on an MTB the weight is more evenly
distributed between front and back wheels, perhaps the equivalent
lifespan isn't so bad after all.

I have run the Primo tires for hundreds of miles at 110 to 115 psi and

Thread spacing in the Primo
is much denser and therefore stronger.
The Kenda tire blows at lower pressures.
I would advise avoiding use of the Kenda gum wall 16" x 1 3/8" tire. It
is no longer offered on the market, but they are still around.

I found that these were wider than the Raleigh Record tyres and
they are quite a close fit for the rear wheel.  I had to bend
the mudguard away using a pair of pliers.  The tyre also
runs quite close to one of the chainstays.  Have I fitted
the axle incorrectly or is this normal.  I have an L5 Brompton
from late 1995.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Norman Tulloch:</EM><BR>
Certainly
on perfect road surfaces the Primos are fine but on rougher roads they
provide a ride which is, I think, harsher and more uncomfortable than the
standard tyres run at 70 p.s.i.
[...]
They do seem to be of quite a light construction
and I have already had to discard one because of a cut in the side wall.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Rob Cope, Nov 1998:</EM><BR>
One distinct advantage of Primos not previously mentioned is they are much
easier to remove & refit, even for the temporarily single-thumbed (fell on
the other one).  Hence it is feasible to mend simple punctures without
removing the wheel (though make sure you do it better than I evidentially
did).

I had the chance to test my Schwalbe Marathon tyres on the weekend. When I
mounted them last week I had difficulties with a small hole in the inner
tube. Most probably I produced it during demounting of the primo tyre. This
is fixed now and the tyres have been used for about 80 km. Rolling
resistance seems to be a little bit higher than the primos. Grip is good on
every surface. Although I pumped them up to the maximum of 7 bar (100 psi)
they are not less comfortable than the primos in contrary I often found
myself checking the pressure because the felt so soft during riding. I had a
hard time on Sunday morning with frozen snow/ice on the roads. The tires
didn't slip but the rolling resistance was quite high. I did not have
another bike to compare to but think it would have been the same with any
other tyre.
<BR>
So far I am quite satisfied.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Mike Hessey, Dec 1999:</EM><BR>
My Schwalbes have now done a rather meagre 18 miles, but I am pleased with
the performance so far. It's been a windy day, and this plus the fact that
the tyres are on my old T5 and I rode last week on my SP (with Primos) make
it difficult to judge performance accurately. I would say that rolling
resistance didn't feel greatly different from the Primos, though the
difference would be in the Primos favour. They gripped well, on the wet
roads, though I didn't actually try to see at what point they would break
away - I don't like coming off! I am running them at 90psi, and I too was
surprised how comfortable they felt even at this pressure. The tyres are
quite silent running (unlike the new Birdy tyres) which is a good sign for
rolling resistance.

<LI><EM CLASS="from">Anthony Cartmell, Dec 1997:</EM><BR>
The leaves probably mostly slip on each other, and tyre choice might not
make much difference unless you get studded tyres or extremely knobbly
MTB-style ones.
<BR>
If you're trying to ride on ice, no amount of tread will help - you'll
come off!  (unless you ride a trike, in which case you will just go
straight on!).
<BR>
You might find that slick tyres, with their larger contact area, are
better than treaded tyres on frosted smooth surfaces.  The tread will
only help if it has something rough or soft to bite on to.
<BR>
As an experiment, just change the front tyre.  It would be interesting
to hear if you find it any grippier.  Losing control of the front wheel
is usually much more serious than the back, and when pedalling you
usually get some warning slips on the back before it all gets too
slippery.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Len Rubin, Oct 1998:</EM><BR>
Primos do have a light tread. Not exactly a snow tire, but not a slick, either.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Rob Cope, Oct 1998:</EM><BR>
Primos have a very light tread which wears smooth quickly, however this has
not in my experience affected performance at all on any surface.  I have yet
to try them on ice, but on other smooth surfaces they out-perform Records in
wet & dry conditions.  One  testbed was the marble-inlaid compass on one of
Morecambe's jetties.  On the Records, I skidded; on Primos, no problem.
<BR>
Winter riding is often on roads wet from a thaw: another situation where
Primos will comfortably win.  The Record has a reassuringly chunky tread,
but this rarely has other than cosmetic effect (plus it tends to pick up
grit of just the right size to puncture further down the road).  Presumably
the tread pattern means it is laying *less* rubber on the road than its
slicker rival?  Moreover, the compound used for the Primo tread is about 30
years younger than for the Record and the difference shows.
<BR>
The only time I have found Records surpassing Primos was an extremely
churned-up canal path just after a rainstorm.  Neither tyre performed
particularly well but the Record tread did just about win out.  By this time
we had chosen to dismount & walk anyway!
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Roland Elsenberg, Oct 1998:</EM><BR>
I agree with Rob that they perform better than Raleighs due to their material.
When I rode into our underground-parking (painted concrete, watered by cars)
with my old Brompton, which is still on Raleighs after months of purely riding
Primos I slipped and fell.
No damage, but lesson learned.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Willi Mindak, Oct 98:</EM><BR>
I have not tried Primos and Records side by side, but I think that in the wet
the Records must hold an advantage.
My bike is currently equipped with Primos, but on several occasions I skidded in the wet,
in particular when going over white lines on the road.
The amout of rubber on the road cannot be the deciding factor for the behaviour in the wet
of the tyre.
The friendly policeman is going to explain that to you, should you be caught with bald tyres
on a car. Raintyres in F1 also have a tread.
The reason is that the tread  can displace water much better than bald tyres,
and aquaplaning is prevented . Surely the same must be true for a bicycle?
<LI><EM CLASS="from">David Hansen, Oct 1998:</EM><BR>
I agree. There are several places I ride were Primos will slip
sideways, such as badly laid setts, where Records will not slip. This
is undoubtedly due to the tread.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Len Rubin, Oct 1998:</EM><BR>
No! True "hydroplaning" only occurs when lower contact patch pressure per
square inch exists (e.g. the combination of the very much wider tires used
on motor vehicles, while travelling at high speed on slick freeways, where
the pressure per square inch of tire on the road is very much lower);
bicycle tires have HIGH contact patch pressure, due to much narrower tires
and fewer of them, plus no high-speed lift effect--hence the rarity of
airfoils on Bromptons!) On very wide off-road bicycle tires, tread is quite
useful, but, despite personal anecdotes and belief/intuition, in lab and
road tests, it proved unhelpful on narrow (1-1/4" and below) tires on paved
surfaces. The tire's construction (tread hardness, tread and sidewall
suppleness) and tire pressure are far more significant.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Rob Cope, Nov 1998:</EM><BR>
The Moulton list didn't produce much direct Record/Primo experience but
suggested the 20" Primo (APB size) is noticeably inferior in wet/ice to

<H3><A NAME="180"></A>Which one is quicker?</H3>
<UL>
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Leonard Rubin:</EM><BR>
There is a mountain of evidence by now, both scientific (various competent
comparison tests) and anecdotal to establish the advantages of the Primos
over other tires. The advantages stem from the following well-known
principles:
<BR>
1. Reduction in frictional loses through hysteresis (a tire's internal
resistance to flexure) translates into greatly improved rolling resistance.
This means that a tire with a suppler sidewall will roll better than a
stiff one, and this is far more significant than pressure--especially in a
small tire, where LOWER pressures often yield LOWER rolling resistance!
This is due to better compliance with the irregularities of the road
(think of it as a suspension advantage conferring the ability to travel at
a higher speed.)
<BR>
2. Reduced rotational mass (especially at the wheel's periphery) translates
into substantial improvements in acceleration, braking and handling.
<BR>
These effects are widely accepted both on a theorectical basis and--more
importantly--on an experiential basis. This does not mean, of course, that
all parties, under all circumstances will immediately realize these
differences. Given a fair trial, however, the Primos will prove themselves
to any remotely objective rider!
<BR>
The most important element in Norman's communique, though, is the
benefit-negating high-pressures he cited. These tires will perform better
under most real-world road conditions at lower pressures (in the range of
45-65, depending on rider weight and road surfaces)!!!
<BR>
Lastly, although I (and many others here) have had great luck with the
casings so far, it is rather intuitive that lighter, thinner tires will
probably not be as long-lived as heavy, thick ones.  Bear in mind though,
that the specific rubber compounds and construction techniques used do
affect the wear considerably, and the greater expense of high-quality tires
is often due in part to higher costs for improvements in both of these
critical areas.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Leonard Rubin, Aug 1997:</EM><BR>[sort of laymen summary of the above]
People are focusing on the wrong attribute; the Primos have reduced rolling
resistance because of the suppler casings, good rubber compounds and
overall performance design, which all result in reduced hysteresis losses.
<BR>
The pressure rating is often a general indicator as to the quality of the
casing, but as previously discussed here, above a certain point, increases
in (operational) tire pressures do not correlate to decreases in rolling
resistance in small tires on real roads -- except inversely!
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Norman Tulloch, Aug 1997:</EM><BR>
I changed to Primo tyres and inflated them to the 85psi indicated on the
sidewall of the tyre.  However, I found the ride to be fine on perfect road
surfaces but uncomfortable and inefficient on anything less good.
<BR>
After advice from other Brompton-Talk people (David Henshaw and Len
Rubin?), I reduced the pressures to 70psi rear, 60psi front.  These lower
pressures make the bike much more comfortable and allow it to run more
smoothly and efficiently.  Though initially I was very doubtful about the
Primos and seriously considered changing back to the Raleigh originals, I
now agree that the Primos provide a genuine improvement in the Brompton's
performance and comfort - but not at 85psi or above.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">David Henshaw:</EM><BR>
May I refer all Brompton-Talkers to 'Folder' magazines issues 17 and 18
which feature, I believe, the only comprehensive tests of the Primo
fitted to a Brompton (and a Moulton for that matter).
<BR>
Yes, in our experience, Len 'Folding Bike' Rubin is quite correct. The
Primo really does roll better with just 60psi for a rider of average
weight. At this sort of pressure the tyre gives a softer ride AND better
rolling resistance than the Raleigh Record. The high pressure capability
is only really useful for heavier folk who will experience the same
rolling resistance/ride compromise at higher pressures.
<BR>
Another advantage of the very supple sidewalls is that high rolling
resistance doesn't kick in until the tyres are almost dead flat. Jane and
I did a regular 10 mile cross-country ride faster than ever before this
afternoon, but I only had 'Brompton pump' pressures in my rear Primo
following a puncture - that's 40psi. It makes remarkably little
difference.
[...]<BR>
After several thousand miles, we wholeheartedly recommend the Primo -
it's lighter, it handles better, rolls better and looks better. A word of
warning though - the frail sidewalls don't take kindly to dynamos and the
'bead' is very easily damaged by ham-fisted removal. Otherwise they last
and last. Strangely, some people haven't bought them yet.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Custfold, Aug 1997:</EM><BR>
Primos also weigh over 30% less than the OEM [Raleigh] tyres,
and there is a common belief that 1 oz off the rotating mass,
is worth 1 lb off the dead weight of the bike.
A bit like the striving in larger vehicles to reduce the unsprung
mass and improve handling .

The tubes I sell are Michelin ref
F432308 - with Presta valves and rated for 32/37-349 or 400A.  They are no
longer generally available in UK but may be available in France at your LBS.
I get over the problem by importing very large batches as a special order to
the UK.  There is also a Primo tube for the 19-349 tyre which will fit the
37-349 if pumped up to arounf 6.5-7bar to make sure it stretches to fill the
tyre I also have these but some people prefer the reliablity of a less
stressed tube at the cost of 30 gm/wheel.  In Netherlands Fiets A Parts has
stocks of tyres & tubes and is supplying many LBS.

Working back through the sums - the Michelin weighs around 80gm against the
OEM tube (Raleigh - made in Taiwan) at 110gm.  The Primo weighs 57 gm.

Primo tyres weigh around 220 gm against 360gm for the OEM Raleigh, hence the

Contrary to

resistance of the Primo is noticably lower than the Raleigh, and it stays
satisfactory down to quite low pressures, so you can get comfort AND
speed.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Peter Amey, May 1998:</EM><BR>

This subject comes up again and again.Some people get a lot of punctures
with Raleigh tyres and some don't. It's not even obviously mileage

puncture more.

Primos are definitely better (for most, but not all, circumstances)
because the rubber is of a uniform thickness, whereas the Raleigh has a
very thin carcass in the tread grooves. These trap thorns and bits of
glass - just try having a look.

However, it does seem Primos are more susceptible to slashes from glass
fragments and a few city cyclists have gone back to Raleighs disappointed.

Raleigh Records are probably as good as any &pound;5

long in the tooth.
The tread design tends to pick up & hold glass fragments which
can then go deeper: checking tyres regularly (espec if you've just rolled
through some glass) pays dividends with all designs.
[...]<BR>
I do find Primos puncture less, possibly because the smooth tread sheds debris.
When they do puncture, they are far easier to get off 'n on: lighter more
modern beading again.  In fact they can often be mended without removing the
wheel, something I have never persuaded a Record to do.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Martin Whitfield, Jul 98:</EM><BR>
The puncture rate for Records is similar to that for Primo tyres so there
is no solution there. The best prevention is to keep them well pumped up -
60 psi should do it. It also makes pedalling easier.

The first 1,200 miles were on the stock tires.  They were fine.  I wouldn't
replace them until they wore out.  Been on the Primos for about 500 miles
now.  Seems to be a difference of opinion on the board, but I found the
Primos to be a bit more flat prone.  Got about six flats on the records
before for I replaced them.  Had three on the Primos within the first 100
miles.  However, I have since put "skins" (tire liners made of kelvar) inside
the Primos and haven't had a flat in the last 400 miles.  Over the same
period I've dug out about 20 bits of glass (4 pieces just this morning!), so
I think the skins work.  Also, when you do get a flat, the Primos are MUCH

were a bit of a disappointment all round, but I know that others are more
enthusiastic. Raleighs have now been restored on both wheels due to the
front Primo wearing out.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">David Edge, May 1998:</EM><BR>
We have them on the front of
all three bikes, but use Records for dynamo rears. I had a Nordlicht
with the little rubber ring which wore away to a point and cut a groove
in the Record outer. Suggest fit the big rubber replacement ring (Chris
Juden says do this from new) and inspect every month in winter.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Rob Cope, Aug 1998:</EM><BR>
Primos are great but intolerant of sidewall abrasion (just like other
quality lightweight tyres).  So you have watch for things like  misaligned
brake blocks - and avoid dynamos.  I really don't think they get on
well: either you damage the tyre or spend forever adjusting the dyno to get
it to work (espec in rain).
<BR>
If you want to keep the fitted dyno: stick to the Records, they're still
remarkably good tyres for the money.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Guy Jackson, Aug 1998:</EM><BR>
My dynamo was slipping on the Primos in wet weather. I than got a ribbed rubber cap from a
local bike shop (50p English money) and it has worked perfectly ever since. The side walls have
not worn any more than the rest of the rear tyre which takes a hammering anyway.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Roland Elsenberg, Oct 1998:</EM><BR>
Wear due to the dynamo is a problem with Primos. But it is easily solved:
Get a cheap rubber cap for the dynamo's wheel. This will fit onto the AXA iQ
that the current models are equipped with. It will probably fit
the formerly mounted Soubitez, too. Another possibility is the Nordlicht
with O-ring shaped rubber-wheel. Unfortunately this is rather heavy and can
on the long run break the point the dynamo is screwed on. I chose the simple
solution with the rubber cap and it worked for some months 9 km dayly. It
will, at a given speed, make the dynamo turn slower, but you will compensate
this!
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Norman Tulloch, Oct 1998:</EM><BR>
I use Primos and the Nordlicht with the O-ring shaped rubber wheel (rather
like the rubber tyre from an old-fashioned model car such as the Dinky).  I
like the Nordlicht which seems to me both quiet and efficient.  I don't know
much about whether this set-up causes fewer wear problems with Primos, but
it certainly doesn't solve the problem of dynamo slippage in the wet.

<LI><EM CLASS="from">Stein Somers, Oct 1998:</EM><BR>
Same configuration here but not the slightest slippage.  I must confess
that lately my rainy rides haven't lasted even an hour, which is the
time it took the original Brompton lights to become useless.
</UL>
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Stein Somers, Nov 1998:</EM><BR>
I cut a slot in
the mudguard (toughest piece of plastic I encountered), moved my
Nordlicht up, so that the thin wheel runs on the black skin of the
Primo.  Surely the rubber wheel is less abrasive than tarmac?  I did
have to saw away the unused part of the brake drop at the dynamo side
(i.e. left side) to maintain proper alignment.
<BR>[Alas it was too late. A few weeks later the outer layer of the Primo's
sidewall tore, the inner layer held the tyre together, but the resulting bulging of
the tyre imposed replacement.]
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Stein Somers, Jan 1999:</EM><BR>
Last year I bragged about my perfect dynamo set-up (Nordlicht on custom
bracket).  Now it's slipping at the mere sight of water...
<BR>
My last hope: it doesn't like the recently installed Raleigh tyre.  I'll
give it a new Primo - although it cut the previous Primo through the thin
line that its wheel traces - that thin line between love and hate.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Rob Cope, Jan 1999:</EM><BR>
I have given up trying to get Primos & dynos to cohabit: even if they do not
wear through, that thin, smooth sidewall seems to have a coating (anti-UV?)
which a dyno (even rubber-wheeled) just will not stick to in wet.  I've
tried most of the suggested solutions (inc several sorts of roller cap) but
I cannot afford to keep replacing tyres.
<BR>
So rule of thumb is decide if you want Primos or dyno: not both.

<UL>
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Peter Amey, Dec 1998:</EM><BR>
Has the design/construction of Primo tyres changed?  I ask because I
destroyed one last year with a Nordlicht dynamo.  This tyre had
cream-coloured sidewalls and the name was spelt with a 1 as in Pr1mo.  I
had all sorts of plans to change the lighting setup on my bike for this
winter but never got round to it.  Inevitably I ended up risking the dynamo
again and (touch wood) have had no problems at all this year.  The dynamo
leaves a clean line on the otherwise dirty tyre sidewall but is not
eroding it at all.  The primo currently fitted has distinctly yellower
sidewalls than its predecessors and does not have a 1 in the name.

Mine was a Pr1mo, mail-ordered in April this year from St-John Street

For example, we
suggested 53psi front and 89psi rear for a rider of 230-260lbs. Note,
these figures only hold true for the Primo fitted to the Brompton on a
'typical' road surface. For other bikes, tyres, rider weights and
surfaces, you need to think again!
<BR>[...] To find the ideal setting for you, refer to 'Folder 18', page 32. With
hindsight we appear to have got the figures about right, but it's worth
adding a few more PSI to allow for leakage.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Martin Whitfield:</EM><BR>
I have had my Brompton for about four years and have yet to have a
blow-out (touch-wood). I have found that the best trade-off between the
an increasing number of punctures and over-inflation is about 65psi. Down
below 55psi and punctures increase, especially on the back.
<BR>
I have no experience of any other tyres apart from the Raleigh Records
which last about 2-3,000 miles on the back and about 4,000 on the front.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">M.A. James:</EM><BR>
Dont go above 75lbs for Raleigh Records Keep regular check ie pump up
every two weeks as they go down fast. Min 50 or they wear out quick and
its hard work....
Best 100lb tyre is primo 4oz lighter little tread faster and at least
15quid mail order.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Custfold, Aug 1997:</EM><BR>
My own observation is done by looking down at the tyre (don't
do this when moving - unless you are very skilled!) and seeing how much it
'bulges' beyond the rim, and additionally 'feeling' the potential of snake
bite bottoming when riding.  Optimum pressure is then achieved when there is
a slight bulge, and no snake biting  on the bumps.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Dave H, Jul 1998:</EM><BR>
Records sidewall pressur is 55 psi - Brompton suggest 70 psi - most serious
riders use as hard as possible, as 55 psi for most riders is way too soggy,
and increases snakebite puncture rate very greatly.  I ran Records at 90 psi
with consequent explosive failures when clinchers separated from tyre.  I now
use Primos with up to 100 psi when properly seated.

My Brompton arrived with Raleigh Record tires that said inflate to 55 PSI.
The owner's manual said to inflate the front to 50-70 PSI and the rear to
60-70 PSI. A "Congratulations to you as a New Brompton Bicycle Owner!"
letter from C.M. Wasson Co. said to inflate to at least 65 PSI. An
additional hand written insert marked "important" in red ink said
80-85 PSI. So I inflated to 85 PSI (my pump is accurate) and you can no
doubt guess the rest of the story. BBBBBBBBAAAAAAAAAANNNNGGGGGG!!!!!
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Ted Mallen:</EM><BR>
Me too, James !
Just got in new L-3.
Inflated to 85 psi as instructed.
After test riding for 10 miles, rear tire blew while proudly sitting in my

It,also, was a Raleigh Record.
It separated at the bead.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Peter Amey:</EM><BR>
I used 80-85 psi for while but eventually had a tyre develop a bulge in
the sidewall (it was quite new too).  I have now settled on 75 psi which
is bearable for rolling resistance, ok for ride and seems to be safe from
unexpected bangs.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Simongikuk, Dec 1998:</EM><BR>
I have Raleigh Records which I inflate to 75 psi for my daily 14 mile round
trip to work across London.  No blow-outs so far, just the very occasional
puncture.  I don't think I've ever inflated them more than 80psi.  Which is
probably just as well, really.

How will the rims stand up to the high pressure?
When my rear rim failed at about 2000 miles the shop who
repaired said & I had over-inflated my Raleigh Records to 80psi &
that had contributed to the failure.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Stein Somers, Mar 2000:</EM><BR>
A tyre holds the air that, through its pressure, separates rim from
road.  Pressure works in all directions, so pushes the sidewalls of the
rim outwards.  The higher the pressure, the thicker the rim sidewalls
need to be to resist collapse.  But the sidewalls are grinded away by
the brake blocks, until at some point they no longer stand up to the
pressure.  The higher the pressure, the sooner this happens.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Mark James, Mar 2000:</EM><BR>
The recommended way of testing whether a rim is safe according to technical
man at Cycle Touring Club UK is to pump up to well beyond usual pressure
tyre unlikely to be damaged etc. If rim doesn't crack etc its good for
several hundred miles.

<H2><A NAME="187"></A>Tyre sizes</H2>
<UL>
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Leonard Rubin, May 98:</EM><BR>
When I worked on the 5th Edition of Sutherland's Handbook for Bicycle
Mechanics, one of my pet projects was to shed some light on the
traditionally murky area of tire/rim standards. The original practice of
naming a rim size for the outside diameter of its tire was workable in the
early days, when each country's tire manufacturers were few and their tires
similar, and each market kept to itself.
<BR>
With the bike boom of the '70's, suddenly rims and tires from different
countries, each with its own national tire standard, started to appear in
the U.S. Virtually overnight bike shops were dealing with several different
diameter rims, all called 26", varying by as much as an inch in diameter,
because one 26" rim was named for its mating giant balloon tire's outside
diameter, and another for its very different mate -- a narrow club racer!
So everyone began carefully distinguishing between "26 x 1-3/8", "26 x
1-1/4" (sometimes referred to as "Schwinn 26""), "26 x 1.75" (rim sizes
descended from original use with hooked-bead tire types were supposed to be
distinguished by decimal width figures), "650B" ("650" was a European
classification for 26" tires and came in various widths with three gross
cross-sections categories -- A, B, & C!; some American mechanics referred
to these simply as "tandem size".) This Tower of Babble got even worse
when, in the 80's, marketing companies like Specialized and Avocet started
selling narrow tires for the traditional balloon-tire rim diameters. This
led to actual tire diameters that greatly diverged from the their "named"
diameter -- it was not uncommon to hear about shops ordering the wrong size
tire based on a bare rim that a customer brought in, or distributors, on
occasion, shipping tires that would not fit the supplied rims from their
own catalogues!
<BR>
When I began to advocate the use of ETRTO beadseat diameters in the 5th
edition, it was still controversial (many manufacturers already used this
terminology, but very few distributors or bike shop personnel did) but when
I contemplated the half a dozen different 26" tires (none interchangeable
with each other) and the eight 20" sizes, eight 16" sizes, etc. -- all
non-interchangeable -- it seemed like it was worth the effort to forcibly
re-educate the U.S. bike industry, by reorganizing all charts and listings
according to actual ETRTO beadseat diameters.
<BR>
Folding bikes generally use a variety of 20", 16" and 14" tire diameters.
Green Gear's Bike Friday models use two different 20" rim sizes. Some
models use the smaller, more common (at least in the U.S.) 406mm ("20 x
1.75") diameter, others use the larger, less common 451mm ("20 x 1-3/8",
although usually paired with the newer, lighter IRC "20 x 1-1/8" tires)
size. Their tires are not at all interchangeable. For each of these two 20"
standards, there exist only a couple of reasonably high-performance tires
for on-road use (you would NOT want to put 406mm department store kiddie
tires on your Bike Friday, as most are so horrible that they would reduce
the ride of that fine machine to that of a very heavy old junker with snow
tires!), with only a bit more variety just beginning to appear, despite
decades of sales.
<BR>
The Raleigh Twenty used 451mm rims ("20 x 1-3/8").
as did many of the folders of that era (the
others used 406mm or sometimes 440mm ("500A")) Early Moultons mostly
used the 349mm ("16 x 1-3/8") standard. (The Moulton AM series uses a
really esoteric 369mm ("17 x 1-1/4") size (you can only buy tires from
Moulton!). Their ATB and newly introduced model use the more common 406mm.
Bickertons used the 349mm on the rear and 298mm ("14 x 1-3/8") on the
front. A clever aluminum portable (non-folding) commuter bike, the German
Kettler City Hopper also used two sizes -- 305mm ("16 x 1.75") front, 406mm
rear. Most Hons (Hon Corporation later changed its name to DaHon) used
305mm rims (many recent models use 406mm). The Japanese Bridgestone Picnica
uses the 253mm ("14 x 1.75") size (the Japanese market version uses 203mm
("12 -1/2 x 2 1/4", as do most children's scooters.)
<BR>
The Brompton choice of 349mm is one of the more common small-diameter
standards worldwide (305mm is another). With the advent of Primo's
lightweight, high-performance tires, these sizes are finally becoming
attractive, because, as any automotive engineer can tell you, you should
design a vehicle around the tire you intend to use with it -- indeed, I
would assert that it has historically been the lack of high-performance
tires that has held back the progress of small-wheeled bikes (one of the
reasons Alex Moulton developed his own tire was to ensure the optimal
performance of his AM bikes.)
<BR>
To return to the original question, either 406mm or 349mm would be
excellent choices, as they are they are each popular standards in several
markets, but it is really the design and construction details of THE
PARTICULAR TIRE ITSELF that will determine to a very large extent how a
bike will feel, handle, and perform, so choose very carefully.
