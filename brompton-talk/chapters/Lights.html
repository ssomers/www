There's plenty of information about bicycle lights on the net,
including Andrew Henry's
<A HREF="http://www.bath.ac.uk/~bspahh/bikelights/lights.html">
Bicycle lights FAQ</A>.
However the Brompton's compactness imposes some limitations
with respect to other bikes.

<H2><A NAME="214"></A>What lights to I need - overviews.</H2>
<UL>
<LI><EM CLASS="from">David Hansen, Oct 1999:</EM><BR>
It rather depends what you do with your bike. A ten minute trip to the
station every week, a 75 minute trip every day and needing occasional
lights if you stay out longer than expected once a month all have
different better solutions. Also important is whether the lights are to
be seen in lit areas or to light up a dark lane or path.
<BR>
On an L it's probably best to replace the rear reflector with a light
with an approved reflector built in. There is also an advantage in
using an approved light (as distinct from the reflector). Without one a
lawyer may argue that you are negligent in any crash. Seat post lights
prevent using a coat that is too long and don't work with the cover
bag. LED lights are now good enough on their own to cover just about
all uses.
<BR>
On the front it really does depend on what you are doing. Personally I
use Vistalites. The Road Toad is good for town use and is small to fit
in a bag. Fitting on the same bracket I have a VL 400, with external
battery pack, for use on dark roads. Which I take depends on the
journey. The former has to be removed before folding, the latter can
just be spun round. Others mount a small light in place of the front
reflector.
<BR>
Batteries are variable. For occasional use ordinary batteries don't
suffer the self-discharge problems of some rechargeable ones. For more
regular use NiCad or NiMh save money and frequent trips to the shops.
If you use lights which take ordinary batteries then you can probably
buy a get you home set of conventional batteries from somewhere if your
NiCads run out of puff. If you have a specialised battery pack you
can't do this.
<BR>
If you do use rusable batteries put the supplied charger in the glory
hole and forget about it. Invest in a smart charger for the types of
battery concerned. Sealed Lead Acid batteries need a different charger
to others. Ordinary batteries and several types of rechargeable
batteries can be recharged in something like the Innovations Battery
Manager, provided they are standard sizes. A specialised NiCad battery
pack will need a specialised charger.
<BR>
I'll add that I also have dynamo lights, these are great as they are
always available if I'm later than expected, at the expense of carrying
the weight around at all times.
</UL>

<H2><A NAME="215"></A>Front light</H2>
Space beneath the panier is 90mm, enough for most lights.
Brompton fits a simple, effective, lightweigth Soubitez.
I have replaced this with a halogen Axa Hilight myself.
<UL>
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Andrew Henry, Sep 1997:</EM><BR>
I use a Busch and M&uuml;ller Lumotec mounted on the reflector
bracket.  To fit this you need a bracket with a 90 degree bend in
it.  The bolt to fit the B&amp;M light needs to be parallel with the
axle.  I had some of these brackets in my collection of nuts and
bolts.  Front lights for dynamos normally come with a 2.4W bulb.
If you aren't using a rear light, you try to get a 3W halogen bulb
fitted when you buy the light.  If you can't get this done, the
voltage regulator should stop the 2.4W bulb from blowing, but its
a bit of a waste.
<BR>
The Cyclists' Touring Club mail order shop sells the Nordlicht
Dynamo for 17.99 and the B&amp;M Lumotec for 10-12 pounds.  They are
having a one day sale in a week or two when everything will be
available for 20% less.  You don't have to be a CTC member to order
things from them.  The address is Cyclists' Touring Club, 69
Meadrow, Godalming, Surrey, England. GU7 3HS.  Tel 01483 417217.

I like it too, but the rear contact often needs tweaked forward a bit.
</UL>
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Richard Lighton, Oct 1998:</EM><BR>
[... I] added a moderately reasonable rechargeable
light for the front--a NiteRider Trail Rat with a neat lead-acid battery
attached to the main tube by yet more Velcro. The bike will fold with the
battery in place, but not with the light, even though it is very small.
Fortunately it unclips from a handlebar bracket that will allow the bike
to fold.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">JP Desbru&egrave;hres, Oct 1998:</EM><BR>
For front lights I have been succcessfully using for two years a double
CATEYE micro halogen with four rechargeable nickel-metal hybride
batteries. Light is very powerful, autonomy more than two hours at full
charge and I use one to light the near piece of the road and the other
one an extended medium range piece of macadam in the middle of the dark
forests of Provence.
<BR>
As far as folding is concerned: if you do not tighten two much the screw
fixing the mounting bracket on the handle bar, you just turn them 90 degree up
to light the stars before folding and this very simple trick does it.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Andrew Heyting, Oct 1998:</EM><BR>
My solution was to fit a quality LED at the top of the seatpost,
and a Vistalite VL 530 on the front. Two headlights wouldn't work, but one
on the left of the stem with the battery mounted on the stem up tight to the
'bars works.
<BR>
This is technically illegal (light is 10W, and 1" left of centre), but I'm
very confident that I can be seen. This set up does not impede folding,
either.

<H3><A NAME="217"></A>How visible is the light while the bag is fitted?</H3>
<UL>
<LI><EM CLASS="from">David Hansen, Aug 1999:</EM><BR>
Very visible where it is most needed at longer ranges. Try standing in
front of the bike and seeing where you can see the light from. Car
drivers are lower down than pedestrians.
<BR>
A lorry or bus driver is higher up, so is mum on her school run in
whatever Land Rovers are now called (but she is looking at little
Jemma anyway rather than the road). They can't see it from quite as
far away, but even here when it disappears from their view they are
about to hit you anyway.
<BR>
In crowded traffic the low down light is a problem as motorists may
well not see it. Personally I fit a bracket to the handlebars.

<H3><A NAME="FrontLightLoss"></A>Front light lens falls off</H3>
<EM CLASS="from">John Yeates, Sep 1997:</EM><BR>
[...] the front pannier frame
seems to rub against the front light somewhat, causing the cover to come
unscrewed - it's fallen off three or four times already!
<UL>
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Joel Parks, Aug 1999:</EM><BR>
Oh yes, mine does that frequently when the bag contains my briefcase (~20
lbs?).  I doubt it's normal but I can't find anything wrong with the way
related parts are installed, so I'm going to rig a safety line on the
reflector so I won't loose it on the road.  Cyanoacrylate (superglue),
stickyback velcro, or some such arrangement.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Phil Gough, Sep 1997:</EM><BR>
Could try just bending the bracket (or reset, as they prefer
in the motor repair trade) assuming it's one of those cantilever
jobs.  They last about 5 years and snap off eventually but they
only cost a few pence.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Nico J. de Boer, Sep 1998:</EM><BR>
[...] even when simply riding a
pretty level road, the front light cover used to separate itself from
the bike, at the most inconvenient moments, forcing me to make an
emergency stop to grab it away before the wheels of approaching cars. I
guess your front light is a "Soubitez" too. However, my girlfriends'
front light cover (of the same age) hasn't come off until now, so
apparently the quality differs between lights.
<BR>
I solved the problem by cutting an "O"-shape out of
the thin hard plastic cover of a food container, ca. 2cm
diameter with a hole of ca. 1 cm, and a cut through the
bottom. Two of those rings between the cover and the
"stem" make cover fit really tight. This solution might be a bit more
durable than tape.

Have just checked my front lamp; still haven't bothered removing it despite
abandoning dynamos.  It has a small hole at the back in the '12 o'clock'
position, which matches a socket on the mounting bracket.  If you can ease a
small screw through both, your problems should be over.
<UL>
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Ian R. Platt, Sep 1998:</EM><BR>
Thanx Rob, but I can't see a hole - I see a kind of dimple, but I
reckon it is either an extrusion hole for the moulding, ir a
reference for you to fit the cover when it comes off!

<H2><A NAME="218"></A>Rear light</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Typical seatpost mounted battery LED lights inhibit folding,
unless they are placed right beneath the saddle.
<LI>Mudguard mounted lights are most likely impossible.
<LI>On a pre-2000 T-model's rack (<A CLASS="quick" HREF="Which.html#L_or_T_model">Which model is meant for me? - C or L or T model</A>)
a vertical stub pointing backwards holds a Soubtitez light
and an L-bracket carries a reflector.
There are several opportunities to mount better lights here.
<LI>I replaced light and reflector with a battery powered LED light.
Its large reflector fits nicely between the sides of the T5's rack
without hitting the ground while folding, and it is not easily
detachable (I never lock my T5 outside, so never need to take it off,
and I fear a detachable light will fall off one day).
I fixed it with two Aluminium 2x20x80mm brackets and holes I
drilled in the rack.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Andrew Henry:</EM><BR>
I have a Vistalite 300X (the old type) on a home made bracket
which is bolted onto the loops at the back of the saddle.
It would probably get in the way of a big saddle bag,
but I haven't tried to fit one.  The seat pin can still
go down all the way.  With the rear light in this position,
it could get obscured if you wear a long coat.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Andrew Henry, Sep 1997:</EM><BR>
The problem with mounting an LED [on an L-model reflector bracket]
is that it is obscured a bit by the mudguard.
It can also get bashed when you fold the rear wheel
under.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Savi Maharaj:</EM><BR>
I use an LED mounted on the seat post.  The post still
descends deeply enough to lock the bike when folded.
The folded package is an inch or so taller than it
would be otherwise, which isn't a problem for me.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Stein Somers:</EM><BR>
I now realise that since my telescopic seat post descends
until it scrapes the ground, it would actually *help*
to fit something at the top of the lower telescopic tube.
[of course you can also shorten it: <A CLASS="quick" HREF="Seat.html#shorten_telescopic_seatpost">Spotlight on the seatpost and saddle - Can one shorten a Brompton seatpost?</A>]

The D Toplicht can fit the rear rack, in place of the existing unit and
reflector (the B&amp;M unit has both light & reflector to EU standards).
The Front Lumotec Plus is vulnerable due to a weak design of clip on the
lens which causes it to fall off in the bag - remedy is to fit extensions
to the clamp bolt plates extending forward to grip the sides.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Mark Lewis, Jun 1998:</EM><BR>
I tinkered with the original lights by replacing the front bulb
with a 3 watt halogen.
This noticeably increased the brightness of the front light
but I wanted then to give this (expensive) bulb some protection
from over-voltage.
In an attempt to get a better rear light, particularly one which
would be bright for slow speeds, I made a 'bulb' to screw into
the standard rear fitting consisting of two pairs of hyperbright LEDs
and two zener diodes soldered onto a burnt out bulb's screw cap.
The zeners stop the dynamo's output voltage from reaching a voltage
which will burn out the front bulb.
The LEDs have an operating voltage of about 3 volts so two in series
gives 6 volts. The nominal output of a bike dynamo!
Because the dynamo produces an AC voltage I used two pairs connected in
parallel with their polarities reversed to give light from one pair
when the voltage is +ve and light from the other pair when the voltage is -ve.
There is also the advantage that, even at very slow speeds,
the LEDs flash very quickly which makes them appear brighter.
I think most of the commercial LED rear lights do this for their steady modes
to increase the apparent brightness. This bulb was working very nicely,
limiting the voltage for the front light, giving good rear brightness at slow
speeds and constant brightness at higher speeds until the dynamo stopped working.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Jane Thomas, Jun 1998:</EM><BR>
The Busch & Muller rack top 4-D lite fits nicely onto the back of the T-
type rack, replacing the existing light and reflector. All you need is a
second light bracket, a suitably sized drill, and some courage!
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Roland Elsenberg, Oct 1998:</EM><BR>
The short lifetime of the rear bulb is possibly due to the small whells and
the suspension. Imagine that the bulb's wire has to follow the vibrations of
the rear wheel on bad surfaces. Due to its position at the end of the
carrier/rear triangle it has to travel a longer distance up and down than
than the wheel's axle itself.
As it does that with the same frequency as the axle, acceleration and
therfore force have to be greater.
<BR>
Replacing the glowing wire by a LED solves the problem. I replaced the
standard rear light by the Seculite Plus by Busch und M&uuml;ller
<A HREF="http://www.bumm.de">http://www.bumm.de</A> . Although this is designed for fitting onto mudguards it
can be put on a Brompton with a little tinkering. On new Bromptons (At least
in Germany) the standard rear light with bulb instead of LED is also
supplied by B&amp;M. If you dare to open the Seculite and the ordinary rear
light
You will see which part of the ordinary You have to use to convert the
Seculite into a shape that fits the Brompton. I managed to do this myself,
but seem not to be able to explain it in english...
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Custfold, Oct 1998:</EM><BR>
The B&amp;M Lumotec Standlicht (ROUND ONE) will fit in place of the normal one,
and the rear D Toplight is almost made for the Brompton - except for the
brackets - yes I make an adaptor plate
<BR>
With the Standlichts you have the best of both worlds - permanent lighting
powered by dynamo.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Stein Somers, Jan 1999:</EM><BR>
About battery lights: I thought a rear LED light was great: simplicity,
full 3W power to the front light, long battery life between recharges,
quick to fix and release.  Then I started forgetting to switch off the
LED light or to recharge it or to take it with me at all. And they are
never absolutely waterproof and their plastic fixing wear.
<BR>
<IMG ALIGN="right" HSPACE=5 VSPACE=3 SRC="../pictures/Rear.jpg">
Now I have a dynamo fed Busch & M&uuml;ller Toplight (pictured here:)
<BR>
It is the brightest rear light I have
ever seen on a bicycle, yet consumes just over 40mA, less than half of
an ordinary rear light bulb.  Its standlight function allows it to work
with a slipping dynamo. Fixed solidly to the Brompton.  Nothing wears.
No bulbs to replace. No batteries to recharge.

The Cateye [LED light] with five LEDs has worked happily bolted to the rear
of my rack for the past 6 months in all weathers and over
cobblestones.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Willi Mindak, Jan 99:</EM><BR>
Yes, the flashing LED's are quite spectacular and equally illegal, at least in Europe.
It is unlikely though that you get into trouble with the police because of the flashing
(they are happy when you carry a light at all), but you should be aware of it.
<BR>
Having said that: last winter I overheard a conversation in a bike shop
(I couldn't help it, it was very loud), where a customer complained that
he had been fined &pound; 20 by the police for a working 'cateye'  LED rear light (not flashing).
The police had told him that it was difficult to see when viewed from an angle,
and he asked the shop whether they had sold him an illegal light.
After some argument the shop conceded that it was illegal.
But you need to encounter an eagle- eyed policeman
(which hasn't slept very well the night before) to notice that.
<BR>
The B&amp;M Toplight with 'Standlicht' (which Stein wrote about) is bright even when viewed from an angle.
It has a little protruding lens to achieve that, and it comes with a German approval (hence: no flashing).
So it should be legal in all ECC countries. Is it or is it not legal in the UK?
Regardless, I'm quite happy with it and  also recommend it highly.
I still have to find the policeman to tell me otherwise.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">T.Lawson, Jan 1999:</EM><BR>
Fitting a 5-LED light beside or in place of the reflector on the carrier
works quite well until you haul the bike up over concrete steps in way that
lets the back end flip under, because then, if you're not careful, the
light, with the full weight of the back end behind it, hits the edge of one
of the steps and gets smashed to pieces - I write from bitter experience.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Larry Chinn, Oct 1999:</EM><BR>
I found a small rear Cateye works nicely on the saddle adaptor pin
being out the way allowing the seat post to fully collapse.
Most light mounts are designed for vertical posts but this one seems to work
well with the more horizontal saddle adaptor pin.  It's also very small but rather bright.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">John R. Bolt, Nov 1999:</EM><BR>
For a rear flasher mount, I removed the original T5 tail light, and adapted
the bracket to carry one of those tiny Cateye flashers. It is so small that
I rarely remove it, since thieves are not likely to spot it when the cycle
is resting on its luggage rack.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">David Hansen, Jan 2000:</EM><BR>
The Cateye LD-500 (I think its called. The oval one with five LEDs
anyway) fits in place of the reflector on a T, if the reflector bracket
is moved sideways a bit (just one hole to drill in the rack). It is
just scraped on folding, scuffing the top of the cover slightly. Those
who are bothered could move it down the bracket a bit. This light has a
BS reflector so the legal people shouldn't get upset.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Jeff Dauvin, Jan 2000:</EM><BR>
I use 2 rear lights - one the same as David & another round one. I
have one constant the other on flash.
<BR>
If you have a long saddle stem fix the brackets to the top of that as
it dosn't go into the frame on folding anyway.
<BR>
The way I fitted them is as follows. It only works if you don't have
clothing dropping over the back of the saddle but makes reasonably
high lights although one does tend to point down it is clear from
behind. I needed the saddle higher anyway but didn't want to buy a
long stem so moved the saddle to the top of the narrowed stem i.e.
high as possible without loosing any of the grip surface. This just
makes enough space for a narrow light holder bracket strap to take
the top lamp. The other (Cat-Eye) lamp which has a belt clip fitting
I fit at the the extreme top of the wide part of the stem. I use a
tube bracket with a fitted Velcro strap which my daughter dosn't use
for carrying her cable lock. The belt clip fits over the Velcro & I
pull it tight so it won't jump off. In fact it is pushed up against
top light. The width of the Velcro (c25mm) means the saddle still
goes down far enough to lock the rear frame when folded.

I use the Nite Rider "bottle style" lighting system with the Brompton,
upright or recumbent versions.  The key is the helmet mounting.  I found
a strap-on water bottle holder that works well on the handle bar stem,
although a belt style bottle holder is fine for the upright Brompton.
The recumbent Brompton works best if you toss the battery in the pannier
on the back of the seat.  All configurations need the standard extension
cord.
<BR>
For skiing I don't usually bother with the flashing red light in back,
but on the bike it is essential so be sure to get two helmet mounts.
That Nite Rider rear flashing red light is extremely bright.  If I have
to ride on busy roads in daytime I bring the rear light and it is
amazing how much more room I am afforded even by truck drivers.  I think
it just annoys them so they stay as far away as they can.  In daytime I
often use the red rear light with the front light off.  It is good for
some 30 hours in that mode.
<BR>
You can special order the Nite Rider with a long cord on the control
which is convenient when the light is mounted on your head.  Makes it
easy to flash people who have their high beams on, etc.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">David Cox, Sep 1997:</EM><BR>
I use a Vistalite VL400 front and an Ever Ready Nightfarer back for
regular Birmingham Motown commuting and occasional late night returns
from pubs etc.
Nightfarer's U2 batteries last for ages with a LED ecobulb (three LEDS
manufactured to fit bayonet socket). I use alkaline batteries in summer
because they hold a charge over several months and rechargeable batteries
in winter - recharging at least every two nights. These are supplemented
by Vistalite LEDs (illegally in UK) flashing front and rear.
The size of the untrendy N/Every Ready lens helps visibility.
I've tried Cateye lights which are bright and very focused
but motorists dont seem to see them.  Above system requires some
forethought but has generally been more reliable than the Sanyo
bottom bracket dynamo systems used on my touring bike.
These seize up if ridden on local lanes in winter when a corrosive grunge
seems to wash off from fields and require regular attention to earthing
failures. Brompton is quite slow enough without adding dynamo drag.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Larry Chinn, Oct 1999:</EM><BR>
For the front light I use a sealed lead Vistalite.
The light mounts nicely to the handlebars and I can stow the battery pack
in one of the pockets of my front carrier.

I also have a helmet rear light and third one mounted to my fanny pack
but I like to be well lit when riding.

On the Brompton I use a Nite Rider Pro 12 with the front and rear lights
mounted on my helmet, and  with the battery in a water bottle holder on a belt
in back.  You can't beat having 35 watts available, it doesn't involve bike
mounts at all, and having it aim where you look is the best.  By aiming with
your head it illuminates street signs, gets drivers attention in the city and
blinds dogs in the country.  Also very good for cross country skiing at
night.  I special ordered mine with a 3 foot long control cable which is
convenient for helmet mounting of the light.

Nite Rider also has a new NiMH battery about the size of a cig. pack, fairly

Apparently like many other Brompton owners, I use a NiteRider front light,
with the NiCad battery in one of the back pouches on the front bag.
Probably uniquely, though, I attach the headlight (15W Cyclops) to the
carrier bag handle. To do this, I machined a slot in a short piece of old
handlebar. The handlebar now slips over the carrying handle and is held in
place by a couple of small hose clamps. With this arrangement, you remove
the light along with the bag--important where I live, since anything
removeble left on the bike for much more than a couple of nannoseconds will
probably vanish.

bulbs. Hardly an environmental disaster, and pretty user-friendly too,
because we fitted charging plugs to our lights. When you get home in
winter, just plug your bike in and the lights are charged by morning.
Couldn't be easier.
By the way, I would strongly recommend anyone with double 'D' or 'C' cell
lights to fit an 0.85 amp, 2.4 volt halogen bulb in place of the
Kryptonite or 'made in Hong Kong' standard fitting. They are pretty rare,
because they hardly ever fail, but St John Street keep a few. These give
a lot more light than the 2 watts you might expect. Infact, set up well,
they look as bright as a motorcycle headlamp and actually force oncoming
vehicles to dip their lights. Unheard of.
And for the REAL environmentalists amongst you, Maplin sell a very  neat
little 3 volt 80mA solar panel, which should be capable of keeping the
lights topped up in reasonably sunny weather - cost about 6 UK pounds. If
I didn't always use a Brompton front carrier, I'd fit the panel to the
light itself, and recharge as I ride. Or I could always put it on my
head. Excellent stuff.

I live in the Netherlands and recently bought a recharging device that
can be used with ni-cads and *regular (non-chargeable) alkaline batteries.
<BR>
To get the most life out of those alkalines, you must 'top them off'
after you've used them for a short while ... an hour or two.
You really can't 'recharge' them when they're dead.
I don't know if these devices are well known or not.

The cost in Dutch guilders was around 70 which would be about 21 British
pounds or 35 US$.

The problem with these lights is that a Brompton doesn't have
water bottle cages, and mounting the batteries there would
interfere with the folding.
Some advantages of dynamos for commuting over rechargeable lights:
<OL>
<LI>
They are light enough to leave fitted all year round.
<LI>
Thieves don't look twice at them.  They are bolted to the frame
and they have no second hand value.  Rechargeable lights tend to
be quicker to remove from a bike, and they are more valuable.
Fitting and removing lights when you park your bike is a hassle.
Rechargeable lights may be heavy to lug around and/or delicate.
<LI>
A decent dynamo system (ie with a voltage regulator, and good
connections) is reliable.
<LI>
Rechargeable systems might be reliable mechanically.  However
you then have to remember to charge them up.  With the battery
chargers which are easy to buy, you also have to remember to
stop charging them.  If you can't charge the battery where you
store your bike, then you have to remember to put it back in
place once it has charged.  Then when you are riding, you have
to remember how long your lights are going to last before they
run flat.
<LI>
3W is always enough light to see where you are going at 12 mph on
any roads around here (Oxford in the UK). 15 mph is safe on most
roads.  Where there are street lights, then 20 mph is safe.
These are minimum speeds.  Often higher speeds are also safe.
<BR>
To be seen by other road users, 3W also seems enough for me.
I am probably more cautious at junctions when its dark, but
I don't find I get treated any differently to riding in daylight.
</OL>
The main disadvantage with a dynamo is that it slows you down.
With a decent bottle dynamo, an average trip speed of 15mph would
drop no more than 1mph when the dynamo is switched on.  This is a
real problem if you are trying to ride at a given pace (eg on a
training ride with other cyclists).  Besides, riding more more
slowly isn't a particularly bad thing when visibility is poor.  On
my 4.5 mile commute, this means I would take 19.5 minutes instead
of 18 minutes at 14 instead of 15mph.  How long does it take to
fiddle with rechargeable lights:  charging them, thinking about
charging them, taking them on and off whilst parking your bike,
and then carrying them around, even when you might not use them ?
<BR>
I guess its a lifestyle choice.  I have tried using rechargeable
lights but I found it too much hassle each and every day.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Clive Page, Jan 1998:</EM><BR>
On my
old non-folding bike I eventually installed a Ni-Cd rechargable and a tiny
rectifier and used the hub dynamo to keep it charged.  Worked well, but
NiCd batteries don't last long and the memory effect is serious.
<BR>
I put a 6v sealed lead-acid battery on my Brompton about 6 years ago.  I
charge it each night from the mains (you need a constant-voltage charger
to avoid damaging them, it is claimed).  It all works so well that I
removed the rim dynamo.  If it every needs replacing I'll consider a
Nickel Metal Hydride type, which is lighter and like NiCd but with no
memory effect.
<BR>
For what it's worth, I recently had to replace a similar sealed lead-acid
battery my home alarm system but only when it had been in use for ~15
years.  Of course, your mileage may vary, as they say.

On my recumbent, a pack of 4 D-cells form a permanent power source.  The
front light and rear light can each independently be powered by that
source or by the dynamo with a double pole, 2 way switch.  That is not
possible if both the dynamo and one of the lights have a mass wired to
the frame, which is the case with all dynamo's (even the Axa HR with its
separate mass contact), and with both the Brompton's standard lights.
(The hinge in the Brompton frame is a bad conductor but not isolated
either!)  However you can still switch both lights jointly to a battery
pack and away from the dynamo with a single pole 2 way switch.  I did on
an ordinary bicycle long ago.  I also rectified the dynamo's AC current
and recharged the batteries with that, but I'm not sure how it all
worked (in fact it didn't).  The obstacle was to separate the batteries
from rain and dirt.  On the recumbent I got a sealed box from an
electronics shop. It and the switches and plugs are well protected from
the outside world underneath the seat and luggage.  On a Brompton you
would have to put everything in a sealed box and find a place for it
free of human and folding parts.  A plug-and-play unit in the back
pocket of the pannier?  Where can one find reasonably sized waterproof
plug-in connections?  How do those remote controlled model boats get
their power?

The advantage of fixing the light and dynamo like this is that you

other), and these wires are more vulnerable to getting bashed.

The Brompton has been fitted with a number of dynamos over the

will destroy the frail Primo sidewall in a matter of minutes (<A CLASS="quick" HREF="Tyres.html#Prinamo">Spotlight on tyres - How do they cope with tyre-side bottle dynamo's?</A>).
We know this is the case because several of you have suffered failures.
The latest Axa IQ design seems much better, by the way.
We'd recommend fitting the more expensive, but much better, Axa HR, which
has a higher efficiency and larger, kinder friction wheel. We all use

The only dynamos I have owned (out of circa 10) which worked for more

the chance to rust solid like all the others (they now have a stainless
steel shaft so that shouldn't happen)  and the tiny 'disposable' one
fitted as original equipment on my three year old Brompton. As it cost
about a third of the price of the others, something of a bargain! I've

I've also got a Union Turbo.  Its OK, but it makes a clicking

is a bit weaker than on a Nordlicht and it sometimes switches on
when you hit a big bump in the road.  I don't think Union Turbos
have ever been fitted to Bromptons as new.  They have a brushed

<DL>
<DT>AXA HR:
<DD>
Good and long lasting on my Gazelle, but too heavy. Tends to break the Bromptons dynamo bracket at the point where the cable runs through. Activates itself due to rapid up/down movement of the rear triangle. When the AXA HR's own bracket broke out of it's plastic moulding I gave up.
<DT>AXA Caluna:
<DD>
Not half as heavy as it looks. Activation unaffected by up/down movement. Broke internally after less than 1 year.
<DT>Nordlicht:
<DD>
Good and undestroyable. Get one with rubber ring instead of metal only wheel. Activation mechanism completly unaffected by up/down movement. Very heavy. Broke Brompton bracket as AXA HR. Since reinforcing the bracket it works fine on my black Brompton. Swap the original rubber ring for a tyre from model car to get it going in the wet or snow if need be.
<DT>AXA iQ
<DD>
Does it's job for about 1-2 years of daily use and leaves the Brompton bracket intact. Cheap.
<DT>Busch und Müller D6
<DD>
Do not confuse with the much more expensive S6 model. Adjustable spring. Slips in the wet even at max pressure. Heavy. Broke it's *own* bracket and destroyed two spokes of my red Brompton. Got money back.
<DT>Union Turbo
<DD>
Very light ;) 99g. Does it's job on my red B. Not really quiet. Gets hot but seems to be unaffected by that.

In fact the new T5 we got a few weeks ago has an Axa
IQ - it's smaller and lighter than the HR. I know Brompton have had a
lot of problems with their dynamos - I would try to get it exchanged, as
the IQ does seem much better - it works well, and dosn't have that
annoying habit of turning itself on. The gears broke after about 5
miles, but that's another story....
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Stein Somers, Jul 1997:</EM><BR>
According to a Dutch ANWB test, the IQ has 5% less drag than the HR.
It is also less efficient, but still quite good.  If one adds a
standard rubber dynamo cap, or a homebrew like Channell did, then it
should slip less than a HR (I don't suppose there's a dynamo cap
for HR's).  Installing a battery powered LED tail light then leaves
enough power for the headlight.  I think this is the ideal lighting
setup: no need to worry about recharging; when one bulb blows, no
danger of overloading the other one; rear light when you're standing
still; and the environmental impact of a pair of batteries might well
be less than the electronics involved in providing the same
functionality based solely on dynamo power.

Zener diodes. By the way there is a new model out with a more

<LI><EM CLASS="from">Custfold:</EM><BR>
One caveat is that the nordlicht should have a larger bolt than that which
normally fits the L series hole, and the claearance and 'tit slot' needed to
properly mount the Nordlicht are not there.  Ideally some delicate work with
a rat tail file, and small flat (warding) file can make the necessary
adjustments.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Custfold, Apr 1998:</EM><BR>
I use the Nordlicht dynamo with rubber wheel running on the rim - very
few problems, put the brakes on and the water is squeegeed off.  As a
reserve the lights are also B&amp;M Standlichts so even if there is a momentary
slippage the rear stays on (slightly dimmed, and the front flicks over
to the very bright yellow LED which looks not unlike a dim battery lamp,
but aided in the oncoming headlights by the bezel which is a clear
reflector around the lens.
<BR>
The Nordlicht dynamo has a couple of nice design features - it has a tit
which will locate in a notch cut in the mounting bracket - thus locating
it positively rather than relying on the bolt being locked really tight.
Then the dnamo rotates on an axis parellel to the rim making the pressure
independent of the direction of wheel rotation - unlike the AXA and Union
models which rotate around an axis at 90 degrees to the wheel movement,
and potentially dragged in in one direction or pushed out in the other.
<BR>
THe alignmant of the dynamo wheel/roller is very critical for best
performance - and the rigidity of the Brompton mounting is limited (you
can bend it by hand), and the rack can also be affected by movement
relative to the rear frame.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Stein Somers, May 1998:</EM><BR>
Another great difference with the Axa HR is the sound: the Nordlight
is truly unnoticeable at high speed.  Below 10 mph it starts
vibrating in resonance with the T5's rack.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">David Edge, May 1998:</EM><BR>
I have had three Nordlichts:
the first broke the shaft after six months
the second vibrates hideously; I moved it to a cumbersome where it does
the same, but there is less resonance
the third sometimes applies with great force, sometimes with little. If
you bend the bracket close enough to the wheel for it to work in low
force mode, you get high drag in high-force mode.

bit of trouble to line the dynamo up properly and to try to get the
dynamo-tyre distance right, but, while the dynamo is just fine in the dry,
it certainly isn't in the wet.

I decided to run it on the Primo, and had no problem so far (but I only did a around 200 Km

Sidewall wear doesn't seem to be the problem with the Nordlichts rubber ring,

I have two of both models and not the slightest doubt that the Nordlicht

I run a Nordlicht dynamo on the rim because I found it damaged Pr1mo tyre

that you can start it spinning again by putting the back brake on which
clears water from the rim.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">davidh, Jan 1999:</EM><BR>
However, I have had
a Nordlicht dynamo running on the (front) rim since Folder Forum.
This avoids any wear on the tyre. The dynamo runs very smoothly. In
very heavy rain it will slip, but it is better than the Brompton
dynamo on the tyre in this respect which used to slip in medium rain.
With the Nordlicht a gentle pressure on the front brake clears enough
water to keep it running, without slowing me down.

Alignment is
important: I used a perforated steel strip (like "Meccano") to move the

Bottom bracket dynamos by Sanyo, Union and some French manufacturer were
popular on touring and audax bikes for a while. I had several years out of
one but others would slip in the wet (leading to all sorts of superglued
innovations with Flymo drive belts) or seize up after getting full of
grunge washed off local fields. The position is very vulnerable to road
crud and spray. Audax riders seem to have moved to high efficiency sidewall
driven bottle dynamos like the AXA and the Nordlicht sold and recommended
by the CTC. The Sanyo was nicely made but would not fit a Brompton in the
standard place. I wouldn't bother.

You can't beat a Sturmey Archer front dyno hub
built into a 16" front wheel.
The drag of the hub is negligible, swapping from a standard front

You can only really feel the drag if you try to rotate the wheel by hand.
The hub is totally silent.

A few notes that may help to illuminate the subject of dynamos.
<OL>
<LI>Tungsten tempco
Pure metals have a resistance that increases by about 40% for every 100
degrees C rise in temperature. This is true of a tungsten filament in a
cycle bulb; if it were not true, bulbs would "blow" more often. The bulb
runs at over 1000 degrees C, so this is a very significant effect.
When cold, the resistance of the filament is very low. If a voltage is
connected to the bulb, a very large current flows. As the bulb heats,
the resistance increases rapidly, cutting the current down and finally
reaching equilibrium. This "self-regulation" effect is useful, but is
not enough to protect bulbs from extreme over-voltage.
<LI>British Standard BS6102/3
This deals with cycle lighting, and has a section on dynamos. It calls
for a degree of regulation in the dynamo itself:
<TABLE>
<TR>
<TH COLSPAN=2>Speed km/h <TH>Volts as percentage of rated output
<TR>
<TH>MIN        <TH>MAX
<TR><TD> 5              <TD>50%        <TD>117%
<TR><TD>15              <TD>85%        <TD>117%
<TR><TD>30              <TD>95%        <TD>117%
</TABLE>
So, the dynamo must not produce more than 117% of its rated output under
any circumstances. For example, a 6 volt dynamo must not produce more
than 6 x 1.17 = 7.02 volts.
<BR>
BS6102/3 was produced in 1986, and looks a bit obsolete. LEDs are not
mentioned. But it is still a good guide, although it should be noted
that "BS6102/3" printed or stamped on a cycle lamp means only that the
maker claims that it meets the Standard. The BS "kitemark" logo
guarantees compliance. If there is a more modern DIN, ISO or US standard
I would like to know about it.
<UL>
<LI>{Richard Pearson, Jan 1998}
I believe there is now a revised version of BS6102/3 which allows LEDs, at
least at the rear.
I have a BS marked rear light which is a large LED (non flashing) recently
purchased from Halfords.
</UL>
<BR>
So if a dynamo - or a Raleigh Dynohub - meets this Standard, it must
contains a regulator of some sort. The cheapest way is to use a
controlled amount of iron in the "magnetic" part of the dynamo, and
ensure that the correct bulb is used. As you cycle faster, the voltage
output increases, so the current through the bulb increases (but not as
much as you expect, due to the "tempco" effect already mentioned). This
current is, of course, the current produced by (and flowing through) the
coils in the dynamo. At high currents, the iron on which these coils are
wound becomes magnetised so strongly that it "saturates" - it can
produce no more current, no matter how fast you go. It saturates twice
on each revolution of the dynamo.
<BR>
This crude system has been used for decades. Note that it limits the
CURRENT, not the voltage. If you fit a bulb with a higher resistance
(that is, one intended for a higher voltage), you may find that it blows
more easily; this is the opposite to the situation if the voltage were
regulated. It is not an easy thing to analyse.
<BR>
If a Raleigh Dynohub from a 20-inch wheel is fitted to a 16-inch wheel,
it will revolve faster, but if it complies with BS6102/3 then it
probably contains a regulation system as described above, and it would
work satisfactorily. But it must be remembered that magnetising iron to
saturation and then reversing it (as happens on each revolution)
requires a good deal of energy (which heats the iron), and the energy
all comes from pedalling.
<LI>Zeners
Putting two Zener diodes (in series) across a dynamo will certainly
regulate the voltage, by "chopping the peaks off" the voltage sinewave
produced by the dynamo. It is, however, from an engineer's point of
view, a really stupid way to do it, because the excess energy that is
shunted through the Zener diodes all comes from extra pedal effort.
Suppose, if the voltage exceeded 6 volts, an excess current of 1 ampere
was shunted through the diodes. This is 6 watts wasted in heating Zener
diodes! And the bulb is only producing 3 watts!
The appeal of this system is that it is really cheap to fit. After all,
an unscrupulous maker might say, it's only a BIKE...
<LI>Other systems.
A "series voltage regulator" would regulate the voltage but has two
disadvantages. The first is that the excess voltage is wasted in heating
the regulator. For example, if a 9-volt dynamo output is reduced to 6
volts by the regulator, and the current is 1 amp, then the power wasted
in the regulator is 3 watts, because the excess voltage is 3 volts
which, if multiplied by the current, gives the watts dissipated in the
regulator. The second problem is that a series regulator requires a DC
supply, whereas a generator produces AC. The AC can be rectified with
diodes but at least 1 volt is lost in the diodes, which is a significant
loss in low-voltage systems. It starts to get complicated and expensive.
<BR>
Much more sensible is a PWM or "pulse width modulator" approach, which
uses a "Power VFET" (a kind of large transistor) to switch the bulb on
and off at a high rate, fast enough to avoid flicker. The on/off
time-ratio is automatically adjusted to control the power reaching the
bulb. There would be almost no power loss.
<BR>
A visit to a bike shop shows that batteries make much more sense to most
users. Cycle lamps are much improved and are now fashion items. Dynamos
are not popular. I have, however, always found dynamos to be reliable;
they never fell off, or went wrong, or rattled or slipped - not for me.
Some other users, of course, have other experiences; maybe they are
unlucky, or careless, or lack mechanical skills.
<BR>
On my Brompton, I intend to move the front lamp to the top of the
handlebars (where it's handy for looking at maps, etc), and fit a 6-volt
rechargeable lead-acid battery, which has a very stable voltage and
needs no regulator. I may keep the dynamo as an emergency charger. Or I
may fit a small "trickle-charge" generator, or even a solar cell. I'm
not sure yet.

use a normal 20''-SON and use it perhaps from 10km/h (or less) up all
time with two normal 6V/2.4W Headlamps in series. She also fixed Magura
Hydraulik Brakes at her new fork: Once she had to brake hard, the tail
went up and the rear wheel folded nearly:)

as Internationaler Fahrrad MArkt. This markets speciality is that nothing is
sold to the customer (dealers only) [...]
I have seen a hub-dynamo in a Brompton with standard fork (70 mm). It was
handmade by Andreas Oehler, who works for Schmidt-Orginal-Nabendynamo
SON. There was a list where potential buyers could sign and state they are
interested in a small series. The price is targeted around 400 DM.
It is a clever device without internal gearing and therefore has high efficiency.
<BR>
I mailed Andreas Oehler wheter he aggrees that his adress is made public
on this list. My point was that there could be bromptonites who had no
possibility of stating their interest for his dynamo by signing his list on
the
IFMA in cologne. Those should mail to him Andreas.Oehler@gmx.de .
He says interest in his dynamo was surprisingly high. He would prefer
selling directly to the customer since he sees no margins for distributers
or dealers if the price should be a reasonable 400 DM with halogen front
light (B&amp;M lumotec with switch)

He had a leaflet on the IFMA.
If there is interest, I'll try to translate later although translating in

an alle InteressentInnen einer robusten
Dynamo-Lichtanlage f&uuml;r das Brompton

27. September 1999

bromSON: der schmale, leichte, getriebelose Nabendynamo f&uuml;r die 70mm-Gabel

Dynamos an Faltr&auml;dern f&uuml;hren h&auml;ufig zu &Auml;rger: Ihre exponierte Lage l&auml;&szlig;t sie
oft unbeabsichtigt verstellen oder f&uuml;hrt zum Kabelabri&szlig; - abgesehen von den
gewohnten Traktionsproblemen des Reibrades bei N&auml;sse... Am Brompton-Faltrad
ist die Montage eines Dynamos au&szlig;erdem nur bei Verwendung des ansonsten
kaum
nutzbaren Gep&auml;cktr&auml;gers m&ouml;glich.
Gerade an Faltr&auml;dern w&auml;ren deshalb robuste Nabendynamos ideal. Leider waren
diese bisher aber nur f&uuml;r Gabeln mit 100mm Weite erh&auml;ltlich, was den
aufwendigen und nicht unproblematischen Austausch der Gabel erfordern
w&uuml;rde.
Meine Erfahrung als Angestellter der Firma Schmidt Maschinenbau erm&ouml;glichte
es mir, den bew&auml;hrten SON Nabendynamo so zu modifizieren, da&szlig; er ohne
&Auml;nderungen am Brompton montiert werden kann. Dieser bromSON unterscheidet
sich vom alt bekannten SON haupts&auml;chlich in der verringerten Breite der
Achse
und des Magnetrotors. Durch diese Ma&szlig;nahmen konnte das Gewicht auf
erfreuliche 450g gesenkt werden. Das gesamte Rad wird somit 50g leichter
als
ein mit einem Nordlicht Dynamo best&uuml;cktes Brompton. Die an einer 6V3W
Lichtanlage erzeugte Spannung entspricht den Vorgaben der StVZO. Der
erreichte Wirkungsgrad liegt bei etwa 55%.
Der bromSON kann radial mit 28 130mm Speichen oder 2-fach gekreuzt mit den
im
Original-Vorderrad verbauten 150mm Speichen eingespeicht werden.
Geschaltet wird der bromSON wie der SON an einem Lumotec mit integriertem
Kippschalter am Gabelkopf. Wer auf ein Dynamo-R&uuml;cklicht verzichten mag,
kann
hier eine 6V3W-Halogenlampe verwenden.

Die Modifikation des SON bedarf einiger Handarbeit und d&uuml;rfte bei
Produktion
in nennenswerter St&uuml;ckzahl einen Mehrpreis von mindestens 80DM erfordern.
Sinnvoll k&ouml;nnte das Angebot komplett eingespeichter Laufr&auml;der zum schnellen
Austausch sein, was mit weiteren 100DM zu Buche schlagen mu&szlig;.

Um &uuml;berhaupt das Interesse f&uuml;r das Produkt absch&auml;tzen zu k&ouml;nnen, w&uuml;rde ich
mich &uuml;ber  entsprechende R&uuml;ckmeldungen freuen.

To all prospective customers for a durable Dynamo lighting system for the
Brompton
<BR>
27. September 1999
<BR>
bromSON: the narrow, light, gearless hub direct current generator for the
70mm-fork Dynamos on folding bikes lead frequently to annoyance: Their
exposed position lets it adjust often unintentionally or leads to cable
damage - apart from the usual traction problems of the friction wheel on wet
roads... On  the Brompton the assembly of a direct current generator is
additionally only possible by using the otherwise almost useless carrier.
Especially on folding bikes durable hub direct current generators would
therefore be ideal. Unfortunately they were available so far however only
for forks with 100mm width, which would require the expensive and not
unproblematic exchange of the fork. My experience as an employee of the
company Schmidt mechanical engineering enabled me to modify the proven SON
hub direct current generator in such a way that he can be installed without
modifications to the Brompton. This bromSON differs from the old well-known
SON  mainly in the reduced width the axle and the magnet rotor. The weight
could be lowered by these measures by a satisfying 450g. The entire bike
becomes thus 50g lighter than a Brompton equipped with a Nordlicht direct
current generator. The voltage produced at a 6V3W lighting system
corresponds to the specifications of the StVZO. The achieved efficiency is
approximately 55%. BromSON can be  spoked radially with 28 130mm spokes or
two-way crossed with the 150mm spokes blocked in the original front wheel.
One switches bromSON like the SON at a Lumotec with integrated rocker switch
at the yoke. Who may do without a direct current generator taillight, a
6V3W-Halogen lamp can use here. The modification of the SON requires some
manual work and might require an additional price of at least 80DM with
production in considerable number of items. The supply of completely  spoked
wheels for fast exchange, would be sensible, which would cost a further
100DM . In order to be able to measure at all the interest in the product, I
would be pleased about appropriate responses.

<LI><EM CLASS="from">Mark Lewis, Jun 1998:</EM><BR>
I thought very seriously about trying to insert some battery backup into the
system but I thought the losses introduced by rectifying the dynamo's output
to produce a DC supply for the bulbs and battery would introduce too great a
loss of power in the circuit to make it worthwhile. Even using Schottky
barrier diodes to do the rectifying there's still a loss of one volt from
the six volts which equates to a 16% loss. Add to this the complication of
isolating either the dynamo or the lights from the frame and I didn't think
it was worth it at the time. I also couldn't fit the battery box I had in
the main frame tube. All this could change when I get around to getting a
new dynamo, though. The new one may be easier to isolate from the frame and
I may be able to find a battery box that will let me get 6 volts worth of
small Ni Cads into the frame. If I can I'll give it a try!

If you have a front and rear light running off a dynamo, then you need

It does make a difference which side of the fork or seat
stay the dynamo points at.  If the dynamo is behind the fork blade,
the rotation of the wheel tends to increase the grip of
the dynamo wheel.  The other way tends to decrease the grip.

You also need to mount the dynamo on a stiff bracket or you will work
more at bending the bracket than making the dynamo work.

I replaced the original dynamo on two T-Bromptons and both dynamo

I "lost" the Nordlicht back when I just had the old B where the dynamo was
attached to a carrier-stay of aluminium. As I could neither do without light
nor without Brompton that winter I drilled 3 holes into the carrier-stay (I

into a square piece of aluminium (5cm X 5cm). This piece got a larger hole
to fit the screw that normally holds the dynamo.

This construction was intended to last until the new carrier-stay arrived.
In the meantime, about 1.5 years, I forgot to order it. Glad You reminded
me...

Yes it's still rubbing/rolling

Then I mounted a third o-ring so that it rides in depression between the
two glued o-rings. Glued this o-ring too but was careful to leave the
soft neoprene exposed to the primo tire clean of any glue. With a little
adjustment and a bit of mudguard clipping, the dynamo can also be made
to run on the black tire rubber of the primo.  Works very well and has
been doing so worry free for some time. W'ere in our rainy season now
and it works in the wet too.  I also use a halogen gas bulb in the front
(6 volt 2.4 watt)--gives a good bright light. The resulting larger
diameter dynamo head runs a bit slower, but this does not seem to

Failing those, there's always temperature - the grease goes a bit stiff in
the cold ! With a little use, the dynamo warms up - problem solved.

I've noticed another deficiecy with the stock dynamo, too.
It turns itself on, sometimes just riding down a bumpy street.
<UL>
<LI>Even my Axa HR started doing this after a while.
I suggest to keep a Brompton free of dynamo's that pivot
around a vertical axis and require you to push
on the dyanmo to switch it on, because its mass will switch it on by
itself during bumpy rides.  Especially with firmly pressurized Primo
tyres, the small inflexible wheels seem to tranfer bumps more than
big-wheelers.

If your dynamo comes on over bumpy terrain buy a spring or a piece of
spring wire, and instal it at the dynamo bolt on so that pressure of the
spring holds the dynamo up.  Then it will not come down over detent and
turn on.  Also I have had success using one or two o-rings over the
dynamo head for better traction against the tire.  This also reduces
power output on down hills and reduces possible bulb blow out.

After 30 mintues of riding in the dark, gone was the rear light.
The bulb was quite black.  I put in another 6V 0.1A, and measured
over 7V, peddling fast but in 2nd gear only!  No wonder the front
light was so bright.  So I replaced the front 2.4W with a 3.0W, so
the voltage would exceed 6 only while peddling fast in 4th gear.
It took 2 weeks before the read bulb burned through again.

The best solution is to use a voltage regulator using Zener diodes.
There are some instructions on how to build one at
<A HREF="http://www.bath.ac.uk/~bspahh/bikelights/lights.html">http://www.bath.ac.uk/~bspahh/bikelights/lights.html</A>

A better solution might be to get a Busch and M&uuml;ller Lumotec
front light as this includes a voltage regulator.  It also
comes with a halogen bulb which is a little bit more efficient.
You don't want to use a halogen bulb without a voltage
regulator as they are more expensive to replace and are
more sensitive to high voltages.

To reduce (hopefully eliminate) the risk of blown rear bulb on my T5
dynamo light I have fitted a an "Xi" Reflectalite Universal cycle dynamo
regulator.  This gadget : "controls the output from any cycle dynamo,
including sidewall, centre tread and hub types" It cost me
&pound;4.06 (Sterling)
from an old fashioned cycle shop in Chichester W. Sussex. UK
<BR><EM CLASS="from">Ian Ringrose:</EM><BR>
You were done, the bits to make one only cost about #0.14 (Sterling) and
you then need to make 2 joint with a solder icon.

When my T5 was new it used to go through rear lamp bulbs at a
great rate, which at the time i thought was due to a few million duff
ones getting onto the market.  Now several years later, with the
original rear end wiring still intact, I have been using the same bulb
for nearly 3 years. I put this down to the oxidation of the contacts
increasing resistance and lowering the voltage a little.

The Axa IQ that new T-model Bromptons are equipped with,
does not feature voltage regulation (i.e. two 0.1 Euro worth Zener
diodes), so expect more blowing light bulbs.

We will have bulbs and regulators (for control of excessive current)
available in three weeks for your Brompton and what a difference they make
over the normal vacuum bulb! Prices:
Bulbs $6.50
Regulators $8.00
Shipping $3 cw
