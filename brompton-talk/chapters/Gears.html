[...] an SA 5
star dealer was at hand when my hub s/d'd and having a dud wheel with a good
hub, I went in to ask for a switch - either the guts, or build the good  hub
in the good wheel.  The units were an SA 5, and a 5-star which I now know
have incompatible guts, and would have expected the SA trained LBS to check
for/know before doing the swap.  So remeber there are at least 3 types of
5-speed SA hub you can have in your B
<BR>
The system lasted about 1 week, and then seized solid because the pawl sizes
were slightly different.  Needless to say the mechanic got his ear chewed
very hard.  So even with Shimano Approved Dealers (SAD LBS?) and other nice
decorations it is still caveat emptor in the service dept.

<H2><A NAME="250"></A>Is it normal to feel a lot of resistance pedaling backwards?</H2>
<EM CLASS="from">Robert Payne, Feb 2000:</EM><BR>
I realize this is not a huge problem since I spend
99.9% of my time pedaling and riding forward, but...
<BR>
On my T5 the chain encounters a lot of resistance when
pedaling backward.  The resistance increases as I go
up in gears.  In first I can pedal backward without
problem but in fifth the chain gets all bunched up.
<BR>
Also when I roll my T5 backwards the pedals move in a
jerking motion.
<BR>
Could these be signs of any particular problem or are
they common/normal with the SA hub?
<BR>
<UL>
<LI>
Probably related to this, is that while coasting there's more intense
ticking in high gear than in low gear.
On a 5 speed, coasting in 2nd gears is most silent and drags less
(verfied in <A CLASS="quick" HREF="Riding.html#rolling_resistance_test">Riding issues - Rolling resistance tests</A>).

<H2><A NAME="gear_trouble"></A>Hub gear troubleshooting</H2>
What to do when gears don't seem to work properly?
Typical problem reports involve: first gear not engaging while shifting down from third or higher gear,
first gear engaging allright but slipping when pedal force is reduced,
horrifying crashing and grinding noises, or worse (like <A CLASS="quick" HREF="Stories.html#SAvi5">Stories featuring Bromptons (all true) - Savi's SA-5 saga</A>).
<UL>
<LI>Somewhere after 1998, the 5 speed was equipped with a ball-locking mechanism.  It can be recognized by the blue ring on the indicator chain, as opposed to the red ring on older models.  This make quite a difference with respect to troubleshooting.

<LI>Cabling:
<UL>
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Graham A. Patterson:</EM><BR>
What you describe looks like uneven wear, which could be due to a
slight mis-alignment in the cable and the cable guide on the axle.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Channell Wasson, Oct 1997:</EM><BR>
[...] may be resulting from a kinked cable.  I had a similar problem
once and solved it by changing the cable.   I used the same cable
housing though after I made sure it was clean.  Then I lubricated a new
cable and installed it making sure all was properly adjusted per Sturmey
manual instructions for Sprinter 5 Speed.  That cured my problem then.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Alan rowe, Mar 1999:</EM><BR>
I have found that the gear cable, along with the brake cable have split the outer plastic
casing where they fold around the rear hinge.  This means rain & salt & rust are able to
get into the cable, and consequently shifting is impaired.  The real problem with this is
that the cable does not move the same amount consistently, and this is essential for
operation of the hub.  The solution is to replace the cable with one of good quality, and
keep it well lubed.  When changing the cable,
also check that the rod which runs into the hub is free to move, and not obstructed with
any grit, and re-grease if necessary.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Jim McLaughlin, Jul 1999:</EM><BR>
I read on a Sturmey-Archer web site that Sturmey hesitated to go with a single
shifter on a 5 speed due to the stronger spring return pull required.  I
believe that the longer cable casing on a Brompton adds enough stretch to cause
it to pull out of first more than on a conventional bike with short cable
casings and a pulley.  Before I switched to a coated cable (maybe teflon or
goretex, I'm not sure what my mechanic put in) I used to just keep my thumb on
it in first.  But now I can back off on the adjustment enough that it pretty
much stays in first.  Maybe a good greasing would do as well as the coated
cable wire.

<LI>Indicator rod:
<UL>
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Mark James:</EM><BR>
I discovered why my gears were dodgy for a while.
It was a couple of twisted links in the SA thingy that goes into the hub,
so take care when you adjust the gearws or else you end up not getting
good changes and no first gear.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">David Hansen, Mar 1998:</EM><BR>
While negotiating one of the dafter so-called access controls in
Edinburgh yesterday, I bashed the right side of my rear wheel against
a large lump of metal.
<BR>
My gears did not seem right despite some fiddling yesterday and this
morning. I seemed to have lost a gear.
<BR>
It was only this lunchtime that I realised what is wrong. The
indicator rod is bent at the end and so will not slide properly into
the gearbox. This prevents fifth gear being selected and I'm stuck in
fourth.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Custfold, Mar 1998:</EM><BR>
<OL>
<LI>
Yes you can bend the rod back - my rods frequently bent on the Sprinter
hub because they have to travel so far out, and lack the chunkiness of
the old AW style rods.
<LI>
Most common failure is however the pull chain.
The Sachs system of ratchet clasp to adjust and much less flimsy chain
(and 1 link more) can be adapted by removing the chain from the rod
and 'screw' and re rivetting to SA parts.
The Sachs' rod will hovever fit AW hub, so only the screw needs changing,
unless you decide to switch totally to the Sachs system.
<LI>
The thread of the sliding dog to which the indicator rod is attached is
if I recall correctly 13 or 14g spoke threaded - hence the useful get
you home option of screwing in a spoke, and bending it to lock into a
lower gear, if cable of indicator fail
</OL>
Dave - who is far more pleased with his Shimano where the gear cable stays
connected permanently, and if you use a friction lever, can be disconnected
without major re setting issues anyway.

<LI><EM CLASS="from">Anthony Cartmell:</EM><BR>
Are the wheel bearings on the hub loose?  Try to rock the wheel
sideways on its axle.  If there is any play this can also cause Sturmey
hubs to slip between gears, even if the gear cables seem to be adjusted
correctly.  To fix you will need to remove the wheel and re-adjust the
bearing cones.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Peter Amey, Jul 1999:</EM><BR>
I rebuilt [the hub] about 6 months ago changing the selector key and a few pawls which
improved it markedly for a while but it has started again.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Phil Gough, Jul 1999:</EM><BR>
Generally pawl wear is indicated by slipping under high load, and being OK when just doddling along.  This suggests that It is possibly the dog clutch which is disengaging under light load, which on the old twin cable type which is what I have been using for  many years, would be caused by too much tension in the left hand cable or somehow sticking due to inadequate lubrication or weakened low gear clutch spring.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Ted Lawson, Jan 2000:</EM><BR>
I was climbing a steep hill on my 1996 T5 just before Christmas when the
gears started slipping something terrible. Changing gear made no
difference. Back on the flat, the bike was just about propellable but any
significant load and there'd be a horrible grinding noise from the rear and
we'd slow to a halt. The chain path was ok and everything external looked
fine, so I assumed the Sturmey Archer had packed in, and phoned up our
local Brommie dealer, Bicycle Doc, in Rusholme, to order a new back wheel.
<BR>
Two weeks passed Bromptonlessly - which, annoyingly, meant staying sober
during the New Year celebrations, because I had to drive, rather than
cycle, back home afterwards.
<BR>
The wheel came, but without a cog, so I set about transferring the one from
the old wheel. It was then I noticed that the cog had a radial spit in it.
Never in many many years of bicycling had I seen such a thing. Cogs with
missing teeth, cogs with their teeth worn down to stubs, but never a cog
with a spit in it. And it turned out that it was the split, allowing the
cog to expand and slip round the Sturmey Archer axle, and not the Sturmey
Archer itself, that had caused the problem.
<BR>
Bike Doc fitted a new cog straight from their stock to the old wheel in 30
seconds, for about 3 gbp, i.e. 1/30 of the price of the new wheel.
<BR>
Moral: don't jump to conclusions, especially about Sturmey Archers, which
must rank as the most robust piece of complex bicycle technology ever
invented.
<BR>
(Bike Doc, much to the credit of their reputation, took the new wheel back,
refunding the full cost, though they would have been perfectly entitled to
keep the deposit.)
<UL>
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Custfold, Jan 2000:</EM><BR>
The 13 tooth cog used to ger up the brompton is particularly prone to
fracture - I have broken 4 or 5 in the 11 years of riding Bromptons, as size
which is usually used for smallest is 14 teeth.  The failure is a pig when it
happens, but often one can limp home with the gear skipping on the
flat/downhill and just walk up hill.
<BR>
Changing a cog is easy provided you have spring steel thumbs and a
screwdriver of appropriate size, to flick the circlip out and back in - the
hub body is rarely damaged.
<BR>
You can usually see the split as the cog is rotated by backpedalling to
inspect it

<LI><EM CLASS="from">Andy Follis, Apr 1999:</EM><BR>
You don't need to get down on your knees.
You can balance a Brompton on its nose so
that the rear wheel is comfortably up at chest height while you check
the gear alignment.  You may look silly (and your bike sillier still) but
it keeps your trousers clean.
<BR>
Turn the handlebars to 90 degrees, tip the bike forwards (over the front
wheel) until it rests on the side of the front wheel and one handlebar end.
<BR>
Maybe this only works with a T-type because you are resting the corner of
the rack against your chest and the weight of the rack holds the rear
triangle in the unfolded position.
</UL>
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Malcolm Lyon:</EM><BR>
On the old style hub (S5/2) - you adjust the right hand rod so that the
shoulder on the rod is in line with the axle end in middle (direct drive)
position - this is in effect the overall 3rd gear postion.  The left side
indicator rod engages and additional gear train which gives an overdrive
effect to give you a super low and super high (1st and 5th) gears.  This
side is easy to adjust - it is either in or out.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Ken Twydell:</EM><BR>
One other thing to check is that the indicator rod does not pull
right out to the end of the wheel nut when in first gear. - or to put
it another way, it doesn't run out of chain. The Sprinter 5 speed uses
a fairly long pull of the control and this must be catered for. The end
of the axle should be only just visible in the 'window' in the wheel
nut. This can be achieved by placing a suitable spacing washer between
the wheel nut and the anti-rotation washer.
<BR>
I hope that this makes sense - the concept that I'm trying to
explain is very simple but my words seem clumsy tonight.
<BR>
Another critical part on Sprinter Five speeds is the cable. I
replaced mine with a high quality outer that had parallel strands
rather than a helix. This was not on a Brompton but a Moulton APB.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Custfold:</EM><BR>
The chain thingy is called the indicator, because it has a lining up (red
line of Sprinter, flat = end of axle 3/5spd) in mid gear or other (Sprinter).
The Sachs system is miles simpler with adjustment in top gear - take out the
slack, and clip cable on, for SA adjust in mid position, and grip indicator
against turning of adjustment nut/lock nut.
<BR>
Fitting a Sachs chain (better quality) to SA threaded adjuster can make
improvement.  Alternatively switch to 1 speed rear hub and front changer for
2-3 speeds (you'll need at least 54 t for normal riding, and 60+ for top
gear)
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Susan Mathis, Mar 1999:</EM><BR>
When you adjust the cable correctly so the gears are in
perfect working order, make sure you tighten the locknut really securly.
I learned from working in a bike shop to use two plyers and tighten the
threaded lockut firmly using the plyers for an even better grip.
It sounds like  your gears get out of adjustment so quickly because things
are not tightened firmly enough.
I've always thought of the Sturmy Archer three speed as the workhorse of
hubs.  Well cared for they should last practically a lifetime.
<UL>
<LI><EM CLASS="from">David Edge, Mar 1999:</EM><BR>
Indeed, but put the pliers on the long threaded part well aback from the
joim, i.e. don't crimp the threads like I did!
</UL>
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Custfold, Jun 1999:</EM><BR>
The long thin indicator rod with the red paint in the groove is used on the
single cable SA 5 speed hub (Sprinter)
<BR>
The old SA (AW unless you have a really old one) 3 speed and the SA5 and
other 2 cable 5 speeds use the flat face of the indicator rod formed where
the top is milled away to fit the chain link to the rod.  When in
second/direct drive (3 speed) and direct/third (5 speed) this flat face can
be viewed through the nut with the hole in as it lines up flush with the end
of the axle to indicate that the unit is in direct drive (2nd/3rd gear).
<BR>
Alf Scroat however uses a far simpler technique wiv yor old traditional (they
don't make'em like that any more missus (AS)) trigger control for 3 or 4
speed (if you really have an old one).  For a 3 speed move the trigger
mid-way between 2nd &amp; 3rd and adjust the cable to get 'neutral' or no drive
position when attempting to pedal.  At this setting the indexing (indexed
gears since 1930's with SA - stuff your Shimano puff (AS)) of the gears
should come out just right.

<H2><A NAME="GRA"></A>The funny roller thing</H2>
I.e. the selector guide system according to Sturmey Archer
or the guide roller GRA according to the Brompton Owner's Manual.
<P>
<EM CLASS="from">Custfold, Oct 1997:</EM><BR>
I has a Sprinter 5-speed, and the changer uses a split slider system with 2
springs to make the relevant dog clutches move in sequence.  This is very
fragile, and I much preferred the simplicity of the 2 cables.  I broke mine
fairly quickly, but not before experiencing some hiccoughs with the gear
change.
<BR>
The seating of that funny roller thingy, cruuuucial.  and if this is
misaligned (and on a B this is easy to do or have done with a slight knock)
then the indicator rod will not run smoothly, and can become bent - my gears
packed up partly through the rod sticking, because it had become bent,
because the roller thingy got knocked and put a bend on the indicator...
stil eventually the sliding dog completly fell apart [...]
<BR> the main reason for the roller thingy - the pull on Sprinter is much
longer than a normal 5-speed, so the rod comes out further.
<UL>
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Ken Twydell, Oct 1997:</EM><BR>
My Moulton APB3 had a Sprinter 5 speed fitted by its previous owner.
It dosn't have the roller thingy but the standard right hand Sturmey
nut as seen on three speeds since the begining of time. It seems to
work well and is obviously more robust. I do keep the toggle chain
greased and ensure that the indicator rod is screwed fully home and
then unscrewed a touch to align with the cable run.  One problem I did
find was that it ran out of toggle chain when in first (ie the
indicator rod reached the end of the nut). This was cured by having a
spacing washer under the nut.
<BR>[...]<BR>
There is about 1mm of the end of the axle visible through the 'window'
in the axle nut so adjustment is possible. When in 1st, there is half a
link or so of the toggle chain still in the exteded portion of the nut.
An extra pull on the cable gives a futher 1mm of free movement which is
the limit of what can be pulled out of the hub anyway. My (early) hub
has no red line, as such, but a raised collar that should be adjusted
so that its centre is level with the end of the axle when in second. I
have painted the collar red in order to ease adjustment.
<BR>
This setup works very well except.... sometimes when I have changed
into 2nd from 1st, all is well until I 'honk' up a hill, when there can
be a single slip of the gear. Tightening the cable adjustment makes
this occurence more likely. This leads me to think that the problem
could be the gear selector key or its slot in a sun pinion being
rounded off slightly rather than the low gear pawls slipping. (I should
add that the previous owner was unable to get the gears to work
satisfactorily due mainly to a grosely over tightened cable - I suspect
that the bike was often ridden with slipping gears) The problem does
not seem to occur as often (if at all) when I have changed from 3rd to
2nd which leads me to suspect that the cable is also not running as
free as might be - hence my interest in the roller. In use, I now tend
to over shift from 1st to 3rd and back up to second. This seems to stop
the problem but I also tend to avoid 'honking' in 2nd so it is less
likely to occur anyway.
<BR>
I must get around to a full disassembly in order to check my theory re
the gear selector key / sun pinion. Meanwhile the cable adjustment is
very critical - but I can get by.
<BR>
I have the HSA488 Gear selector guide (roller) and
the HSA 128 Axle nut. All I need is the HMW150 lockwasher and the
HSA480 Gear selector guide support washer.

I've been riding 1-speed Bromptons for almost as long as having ones with
working gears.  The current Sprinter went grind crunch about 6 months back,
and when I took out the body, the high/low gears fell out in pieces.  I knew
the remaining life was limited, and the stresses set up in a hollow axle with
a long slot in it are formidable with my riding
(<A CLASS="quick" HREF="Luggage.html#Custfold">Transporting (more) luggage with a Brompton - Dave Holladay</A>).
So I visited my friendly wheelbuilder, and took away a
28 hole hub with sealed bearings, split down a SunTour 5 cluster (relatively
thin for a freehub), and screwed the 14 (or it may be 13), hard on to the
shoulder - et voila, a 3x 28h single speed hub. which is a delight to ride,
apart from the fact that the biggest ring I could get in town was a 54.  I
think I can get a 60 from Middleburn ex stock, but suspect that a 64-66 would
be ideal, to have as high/low on a front changer.  Shimano/Sakae crank (130
pcd?).  It is wonderfully light and whizzes along if only I could pedal fast
enough.
<BR>
SA's can occasionally be 'sticky' especially it seems on the Brompton as the
pedals often drag round when they could be freewheeling.  In excess this
force would appear to be low enough to resist by holding the pedals back, but
sufficient to force the drive against the sprocket, and in the manner of a
fuse (with a relatively small sprocket for the hub - compared to
manufcturer's normal fitting for 26" wheels) the sprocket breaks.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">____HPVert Alert____, Aug 1998:</EM><BR>
The Star 5 hubs [older SA5 model] were
introduced in 1991, and I had the misfortune of getting one in
my Brompton in 1992. In 1994, after 2 years of light use, and
less than 1000 km ridden, the hub developed annoying random, but
cyclic[sic] "clicks". I could not find a qualified SA mechanic
locally (Stockholm, Sweden), so in the end I had it opened up
and examined by a Sachs technician. He could not find the cause
of it either but remarked that the pinion cogs looked well worn
out. Anyway, I'll spare you the gory details, but the gist of
it is that I had to decomission the bike, and, unwilling to throw
good money after bad, am sitting here with --to me--  worthless
[GBP] 500+ Brompton frame.
<BR>
Rumor has it that, because of the notoriously malfunctioning
Stars, he Sturmey Archer has been known to replace them free
of charge with the newer Elite 5's (which are an entirely new
construction, ergo should be better). But of course this doesn't
apply to those in faraway countries on the continent, because
my faxes to SA about it weren't even replied to.  And the
Brompton apparently washes its hands as well. Not their problem.
<BR>
Lest you'll think that I am making this all up, let me quote
verbatim from the book "Sturmey-Archer, The First Ninety Years"
by P.M. Read (emphasis mine):
<BLOCKQUOTE>
TYPE '5-STAR' 5-SPEED WIDE RATIO (MK.1) (1991)
<BR>RATIOS = -33.33% / -21.1% / D / +26.6% / +50%
<P>
This is the new ( N.I.G. ) 5-speed which is of a totally new
design concept, (even though the ratios are exactly the same as
the previous S5/2 system) and the only part of this hub internal
which partially resembles original S.A. hub gears is the gear
ring. This design incorporates a new type of semi-planet cage/
platform with the low gear pawls operating from a 'Spring-ring'
system on the lower edge, which is not unlike the internal pawl
and ratchet system of Shimano hubs. The planet pinions are
cantilevered out from the centre and held in place by new pattern
pinion pins which have a grove cut in the lower end so as to
engage on the pawel spring ring which protrudes through the pinion

The 3 speed AW has essentially been in use almost unchanged since the early
1930's with many pre-1939 3-speeds stil chugging along (please can I get a
fixed one someone! as these are no longer made).
<BR>
The current AW model is the survivor of a much larger range which included
close ratio and fixed gear.
<BR>
The simplicity is that through a slot in the axle a dog clutch locks elements
of an epicyclic gear unit.  On the 5 speed an additional bit of slot has
another dog clutch, which switches basic hi-lo gear - which on the 2 cable SA
hubs was operated from the Left side.  In their wisdom designers found that
by making a split   part in the dog clutch which reacted to its position
against the 3 speed stops, the 2 speed change could operate on the overtravel
of the indicator rod as the gear cable was pulled.
<BR>
All sensible equipmant works on the KISS principle - hence reliable Dutch
roadster bikes have 1 gear and coaster brakes - no cables to snap - no brakes
to wear out rims etc.
<BR>
Weighing 95 Kg and generally finding the standard Brompton rather low geared
(i use a 56 tooth ring on 1 bike, and a 61 tooth on another) I also
discovered very early on that the bigger slot in the 5 speed axle and tiny
bits of the gear change did not last at all - axles snap, toggles fall apart
etc.  So for a good basic reliable bike get the 3 speed, and if possible get
the old metal trigger - the new one is rubbish, and does not easily allow the
old trick of setting up the gears by holding the trigger mid-way between 2 &
3 and locating the null spot.

Why are hub gears so designed that when the control cable or toggle chain
breaks one is left in top gear which is unpushable rather than bottom
gear which would always allow one to get home however slowly?
<UL>
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Custfold, Sep 1997:</EM><BR>
In terms of safety the failure of a gear indicator chain, or cable,
will cause the gear to immediately change.
This would be mildly embarrasing at low
speed if the gear suddenly becomes high
(you suddenly find it very hard work,
and stop).  Now imagine instead the failure of a gear change when really
pushing it at 20+mph in top gear and then shooting into bottom gear.  On a
cumbersome this can often result in rapid engagement with the crossbar (one
reason why cable guides on the top are rather a silly modern idea,
old frames had cables along the bottom edges of the top tube)
<BR>
It is a pain but one get you home trick is to use a spare spoke (which of
course you carry inside the rear frame) and this will screw in to the hub.
This is than pulled out and bent over in whatever gear you want.
Another is to note that in bottom gear the indicator is actually about 1/8"
proud of the end of the axle (the flat on the indicator shouls align
with the end of the axle in mid-gear - that's why its called an indicator!).
With a bit of care the indicator can be pulled out, possibly unscrewed
a bit, and bent to jam in the axle in bottom gear.
The 5 speed Sprinter has considerably more stiff bit to pull out
and bend over - as it has a red line to set up the gears with.

My Moulton APB S7 has the new Sturmey Archer 7-speed hub gear, and it is
designed to fail in first if the cable breaks.
<BR>
According to Tony Hadland's excellent book, Sturmey did make a hub in
1905-1908 that also failed in bottom gear. I don't know why they changed
the design to fail in top. Also the BSA 3-speed hub failed in bottom
gear.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Custfold, Sep 1997:</EM><BR>
This it may do but I do wonder on the effect of a cable/chain failure when
one is belting along in top gear - the Shimano Nexus incidentally does the
same bottom gear = slack cable.  A penny pinching idea is to use a friction
lever, with all stops cut off, which I have used until I got the rapid-fire
changer, but have yet to fit - getting rather used to fishing for gears, and
the rapid change possible with the friction lever.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">R.E.Burton, Sep 1997:</EM><BR>
My original query was prompted by my experience with the hub gear on the
Brommo.  The incidents, and I wonder how common they are, consisted of
a failure of the key *inside* the hub into which the toggle chain screws
whereby the thread becomes worn so that the toggle chain slips out.  The
internal must be dismantled in order to replace the key.  This has
happened to me about four or five times over the years.  I don't complain
about cable wear and tear - that is only to be expected.

Surely You have a Sprinter 5 with one cable and one gear changer instead
of the 5 StAr on older Bromptons with two 3-Speed gear changers.
<BR>
My B's Sprinter has this inconvenience too. Shifting from 2nd to 1st gear
is, like shifting from 4th to 5th, done by locking the big inner gear on to
the
hub's axle instead of the small one used for 2nd and 4th.
<BR>
This locking is done by a small sliding key protruding from the axis fitting
grooves in the two inner gears, the suns of the two involved planetary
gears.
Due to the different transmission ratios the two suns rotate in respect
to each other. So it is likely that the key, coming from 2nd (small sun)
tries
to get into the big sun (1st) just between two grooves of 1st gear.
Tightening the cable will then press it against a solid part of the gear.
Therefore it is unable to move further. Only moving the pedals will turn the
gear so that the key finds the groove and slides into it.
Then the gear changer will not pop out of of 1st gear.
<BR>
Shifting from 4th to 5th is similar, but this is done by loosening the
cable.
A spring will move the key the next time a groove passes.
<BR>
Cure:
Try to pedal idly while shifting into 1st.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Ken Twydell, Jul 1999:</EM><BR>
To get into 1st gear you are selecting a different sun pinion to be
meshed with the axle by sliding across a raised 'thingamy' located in a
slot in the axle (in the Sprinter hub). As the two sun pinions rotate
at dfferent rates, the chances of the slots in both suns being
perfectly aligned when at rest are remote. Therefore, it is recommended
that you are moving and pedaling gently when selecting 1st - as seems
to be born out by your findings.
<BR>
<BR>
When in first gear (ie actually engaged rather than merely selected at
the changer), I find that the cable should not be too tight. A pull on
the exposed cable should still allow a minute amount of movement at the
toggle chain.
<BR>
When in 5th (again actually engaged!), the cable should be quite slack.
The large amount of movement between 5th and 4th gear on the lever
should take up all of the slack and still provide a fair degree of
movement at the toggle chain.

The problem with the many new 7-speed
(and higher) hubs is that they are all 135mm or so in width, and the
Brompton's rear triangle measures 110mm. While it is possible to "cold set"
(force bend to a new width) a steel frame a few millimeters to accomodate a
different width hub, in this case the difference is far too great.
<BR>
For this reason, I have designed and built some prototype replacement rear
triangles, in both steel and titanium to accomodate wider hubs, and, when
combined with my weight-reduction diet (lots of tasty components and custom
bits that I sell) the results are quite astounding!
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Leonard Rubin:</EM><BR>
This is not the only barrier to their use
by any means, as limited spoke hole drillings, excessive weight, limited
range, high frictional losses, noise, interference with the Brompton chain
tensioner (clever derailleur-like thingy), cable-routing and shifter
clearance challenges make them somewhat unattractive. I have heard rumors
of an upcoming very light, high-performance 14-speed hub from Rohloff, and
a design project along those lines from Spinergy, but in the 20 years I
have been active in the bicycle business, I have become, lets say, a tad
skeptical regarding the likelihood of true "high-performance"
internally-geared hubs (read narrow, lightweight, efficient, wide-range,
etc.) appearing in the marketplace, due mostly to reluctance on the part of
investors, manufacturers, distributors and retailers to operate outside of
conservative financial assumptions.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Custfold, Oct 1997:</EM><BR>
Alternatively fit a Sachs 12-speed/Shimano 7 in a
widened & strengthened rear frame, I've done the latter,
but the brake has to come off to make it fit,
and it weighs a lot more.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Custfold, Nov 1998:</EM><BR>
I have done the conversion [to 7 speed hub] - it may be that we can offer this in the very near
future as the 'prototype has now covered many miles at moderately high speed
and loads
<BR>
One caveat though the spokes are well under 4.5" long and thus at seriously
bad nipple entry angle and severe bend over the outside of the flanges - the
bike also gains about 1.5lb IIRC.  The wheel took 3 months to get finished but
we got the basics worked out and swore a lot.
<BR>
The rear triangle is rebuilt but using essentially the same unit - new drop-
outs shorter w/base (about 8mm) and for me extra bracing at weak pivot point -
and the chain tensioner has to be changed as it don't work with the nexus
unit.
<BR>
I'm working with a frame builder and also deal with the sub contractor who
built many Aerobikes frames, and makes some of our accessories, so we may have
something interesting soon.
<BR>
I would stress that
<ol>
<li>the spokes are very short and hard to lace up
<li>the hub and extra spokes do weigh more (a fair lump more!)
</ol>
Still the 104" top gear is much more comfortable when I open up to speed in
town
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Custfold, Mar 1999:</EM><BR>
I have been riding a Nexus 7 less brake with modified chain tensioner for over
1 year now - you saw it at Coach & Bus '97 IIRC - it was at Ventnor and
appeared on FAQ pictures (bike was white - now red-ish with black & purple
bits IIRC), and many Brompton users have seen (and some ridden) the bike - it
has Cantilever brakes etc and we may be making some more conversion frames
very soon - as the long term testing seems to be proving the unit - apart from
a difficulty in getting spokes and reducing spoke breakage tendencies
(although this is with me riding it) - could Mr Parry have had the tape
measure out at Ventnor perhaps?
<BR>
The Nexus gear range is great and the hub is smooth (for me).  Other pluses
are that one does not need to remove the gear cable when working on tyres with
the wheel out.

The usual wisdom when this topic is raised is that at the
extreme ratios, lowest  and highest, the efficiency losses
are about 5  per cent, and on direct drive equivalent to a
derailleur. But bear in mind that most derailleurs that one
sees around are not well maintained or adjusted and are
generelly filth-lade so in practice these must be loosing
at least 2 per cent IMO.  The Brompton chain tensioner must
also impose its share of spring load and friction.

The 5-speed Sturmey is less efficient than the 3-speed in gears 1 and 5.
Try riding up the same hill on a 3-speed in gear 1 and a 5-speed in gear
1. The lower gearing on the 5 gives no real advantage. I was sceptical
until Andrew Ritchie, the man himself, demonstrated this. Now I believe
it. And the 5 is very adjustment-sensitive, unlike the 3, which lasts
forever and ever.
<BR>
On a 5-speed, I'd go for a 14-tooth sprocket, which gives about 8% lower
gearing. But, please remember to change the shim pack - the 14T is
thicker than the 13T...
The 12% optional lower gearing is certainly worth fitting on the 5-speed
if you want really low gearing, but I'm not sure about the 18% - a front
changer is probably a more sensible option.
<BR>
I'm still happiest with a light, efficient 3-speed with standard gearing.
My clunky old bike still holds the unofficial Brompton speed record, set
at CycleFest 1996 by Richard Grigsby.

Just to add fuel to the fire - the
5-speed seems to vary in efficiency, but I can't say I've ever noticed
this effect with the 3. Many years ago, Sturmey used needle roller
bearings in the pinions, but decided the cost wasn't worthwhile. Maybe
they should go back to rollers on the 5 and 7-speed...

No surprises here. Legend had it that 1st and 5th gear were a bit harder to work. Third gear is best with no internal ratio; I take it the 4% are just bearing/ chain losses.

I have found the original 2-cable 5-speed of my Brompton T5 reliable - I
only bought a single cable 5-speed recently (on a Micro, rather than a
Brompton). On the older one, using the lowest gear feels like pedalling
through treacle - ie inefficient, and only used in emergencies. The newer
one feels much better in this respect.

In the 1998 catalogue, Sachs gave the efficiency of its three-speed hub as 94% in low gear, 97% in direct gear and 93% in high gear. This corresponds to the numbers for 200W input in the Radmarkt / Pro Velo article. At 100W, the efficiency is hardly 93%-96%-91%.
AFAIK SRAM has not changed the internals of the three-speed hub (only 5- and 7-speed), so these numbers should apply to the present Bromptons, too.

My guess: in the extremer gears, the planets in the cage roll on a
bigger central fixed cog, hence they are smaller in diameter and make
more rounds per minute.  Both factors increase the friction at their
(simple) bearings.  Maybe on top more than three planets are needed to
cope with the driving forces because the teeth on a smaller planet make
less firm contact with the central cog.
<BR>
Come to think of it, the basic planetary system can only reach a 2:1
drive ratio using infinitely small planets.  That's a 400% gear ratio,
low to high gear.  (SA-3 has 178%, SA-5 has 225%).  So how does the

The reason for the extreme high/extreme low being accessed by pulling the
second lever should give a clue - the old SA5 system used a second cable to
pull the dog over on the LHS of the unit and engage a step-up ratio in the
drive chain - otherwise the middle 3 were direct into the gear cage.  This in
turn means a bigger slot in the axle and extra little piece to slide in it for
all 5 speed hubs.  The Sprinter merely uses a longer pull stroke to operate a
2-stage little bit in a slot from 1 cable.

Little mention has been made of lubrication.  Sticky Sturmeys frequently

to forget their housetraining for roughly a fortnight (and of course, once
you switch to oil you have to keep to it). One reason I stick to an ancient

My favourite Brompton to ride of the fleet is the 1 speed with gearing around
70  inches (61-14).  It is actually a bit undergeared for my liking but no-
one's offered a 64/65 ring yet and that is about the limit on size before the
front forks foul the ring.
<BR>
1 speed has shed around 3 lb from the bike and the complexity of another
cable, a trigger etc and it has minimal loss from hub inefficiency.  Ideally
of course I'd ride 61-13 fixed but the Brompton doesn't work with fixed gear
... unless you get the chain setting exactly right in the unfolded state, that
would get rid of all unsightly cables between front & rear frames, about 10 oz
of brakes and a brake lever.  The 1 speed like the 1 speed Micro is a light
and joyful machine KISS as they say.  In riding a lighter bike the effort to
climb hills and accelerate is less so you can use higher gears.
<BR>
BTW note that in fixed one tends to be able to ride higher gears due to the
assistance of inertia - my standard bike on one of 3 frames has a 100" fixed
gear, and rides up all but the worst hills.

Today's Sturmey Archer 5 speed is called Sprinter and has a single cable.
Before there far the 5 Star...

In fact, there were at least two versions of the 5-spd SA with cables
running to both sides of the axle.  One used an indicator chain on both
sides, the other used an indicator chain on the drive side and a bell crank
driving a pushrod on the non-drive side.  I (ab)used the former for several
years while a student in Boston, only to retire it when I found the hub
shell had developed 3 cracks in the axial direction from the drive side
almost to the non-drive side.  I was in the habit of flying off curbs at
full speed, not to mention the bad roads and trolley tracks.  I broke a
couple of axles too.

I too have a Sturmey with two shifters, the kind Joel described with the two
indicator chains. The hub contains two planetary gears which share the outer
ring and the cage containing the planets. The right cable works like that of
a 3-speed. The left one pulls a key through a slot in the axle and locks the
small
or the large sun-wheel onto the axle. Although the left shifter is borrowed
from the 3-speed only two
positions are used. This gives 2 * 3 = 6 possible combinations. When the
small sun wheel is locked the
right shifter works like that of a conventional 3-speed but with a faster
1st and a slower 3rd. Locking
the big sun wheel also gives a 3-speed, but with a slower 1st and a faster
3rd. Like with the 3-speed,
the middle gear has a 1:1 ratio. Thus both middle gears, small or big sun
locked, have a 1:1 ratio.
Therefore 6 positions give only 5 gears.
Shifting through all 5 gears goes like this:
<UL>
<LI>Start in 1st, left cable loose (2nd), right in 1st position
<LI>then 2nd gear: tighten the left cable (1st), right stays in 1st
<LI>3rd gear: right shifter in 2nd position, left stays in 1st
<LI>4th gear: right shifter in 3rd position, left stays in 1st
<LI>5th gear: loosen left cable (2nd), right stays in 3rd position
</UL>
It is easier done than explained.
<BR>
To me shifting seems to be faster than with the sprinter. As the key is
moved only from 1st to 2nd and from 4th to 5th most of the work is done with
the right shifter. Like with a 3-speed it is possible to abuse the hub by
shifting upward without taking force of the pedals.
Since 5 months I have only ridden the Sprinter type because I favour the
Schwalbes on the new bike, but this discussion reminds me of the merits of
the 5 Star (two cable type). Perhaps I try tomorrow. Only disadvantages are:
The axles left end sticks out about 1" and some people get confused by two
shifters. Otherwise I would prefer it.
<BR>
It certainly is more tolerant [of misadjustment], since the indicator rod travels like that of
a 3-speed roughly the same way for 3 positions where the Sprinters rod has 5
positions. The relative effect of misalignment must be smaller. On the other
hand only the Sprinter has the trolley.
When the cable of my Sprinter has lenghtened a bit the hub tends to stick in
4th gear when I put the shifter to 3rd. To give the same effect, the old
5StAr must be severely misaligned.
The difference is minor to the difference compared to Sachs (now SRAM) hubs.
All Sturmeys shift way faster than all Sachs I have ridden so far.
