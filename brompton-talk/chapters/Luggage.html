My 5-year-old Brompton has a much stronger back-carrier than my 1-year-old.
I have transported many people of 60 to 80 kg, standing on the back-carrier
of the old one.
When I tried that on the new one, it broke almost instantaniously.
My father-in-law managed to re-weld it.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Clive Page, May 2000:</EM><BR>
I've just got a new Brompton to replace my old one (~13 years old and
with rather a lot of bits needing replacement).   It's an L5 plus a rear
carrier (which I need to carry my briefcase to/from work) which is
essentially a T5 less the dynamo lighting as I prefer to rely on
batteries. [...]
<BR>
The rear carrier is now made of light alloy: no doubt lighter and it
seems strong enough but when negotiating stairs I need to grasp the
carrier in my right hand, and the new one is much sharper on the
fingers.  I've now wrapped some tape around the critical bit.

I've carried a box containing a self-assembly office chair on my T3. The
box was an 80cm cube. It fitted quite nicely on the rear carrier and I
secured in using bungees around the seat post. I wouldn't have been able to
carry it on any of my "conventional" bikes. I've found that the large gap
at the back, between the tiny wheel and the long seatpost, allows the
Brompton to carry really bulky loads.

A couple of weeks ago I bought an 8' long white melamine shelf from a DIY
superstore.  I found that the corner of one end slotted into the rear rack on
my T5 while the other rested on the handlebars and protruded out front,
almost like a sail. I made slow but steady progress on the 2 miles journey
home but had to be careful not to let the shelf interfere with the stearing.
As you can imagine, I got a lot of looks from passers by!

I've just read in a 'Cycling Plus' March issue, a review of 'Radical Design
Brompton Rear Rack Bag' &pound;65.  Has anyone seen or used it?  How big is it?
<BR>
The review reads as follow:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Along with this firms's newly developed panniers for recumbents comes this
bag,designed specifically for use with the award winning Brompton folding
bike.  The bag is made from tough Cordura proofed material and most of it is
padded to add structural stiffness.  The bag is secured to the rack by
sliding the seatpost through the nylon hoop at the front.  A snap closure
ensures the rear part of the bag stays put.
<BR>
It was good to see a large, easy to use zip here, and there is a mesh upper
portion for placing wet outer garments in.  Natty finishing details include
a hoop for attaching a rear Knightlite and hooks to accommodate a shoulder
strap.  (Paul Vincent)

The secret is to get a ratchet down webbing unit (chandlers store) as used to
tie down boats, and a miniature version of those things you see on
curtainsider trucks or holding down loads on flat bed vehicles.  Bungees are
terrible for most load securing as they have too much stretch - webbing and
the right buckle is much safer.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Simon Risley, May 1999:</EM><BR>
Underneath the two rails that form the sides of the rack, and about two
thirds of the way towards the front, are two small downward-pointing squarish
lugs - one on each rail.  They are of suffucient size and strength to use as
"stoppers" to prevent any loads you carry from sliding forward and hitting
your heels.  Either by ensuring that the bungees' two plastic hooks are
hooked in BEHIND the two lugs or, if your load is smaller, by attaching the
hooks to the horizantal bar that has the two plastic castors (the way the
bike normally looks) and just hooking the two cords on each side - or even
just one of them - under the lugs.  You can also cross one or both of the
bungees on either side over your load and catch them onto the lugs on the
opposite side, so producing an "X" pattern which holds your load more
securely.  It works very well.
<UL>
<LI><EM CLASS="from">David Hansen, May 1999:</EM><BR>
Sometimes I cynically think [the lugs] are for a different reason. If for
some reason the seat is difficult to get up then they are excellently
placed to put a hole in the bottom of one's shoe as one pulls it up:-(

For waterproof luggage that takes A4/foolscap sheets flat you can't go far
wrong with a UKP 2.99 Sainsbury box, with UKP0.99 lid, on our large carrier
frame - waterproof but not watertight (ie will sink eventually if chucked into river).
Or for watertight luggage get the frame with a top box (waterproof at
70+mph on a motorbike).

<H3><A NAME="116"></A>The rear carrier's bungee straps</H3>
<EM CLASS="from">Ann Jones, Apr 1998:</EM><BR>
Having very recently become the proud owner of a brand new T3, I had my
first excuse to take the bike out (thanks to all the lovely weather we've
been having) and use the rear carrier.
<BR>
I tied my stuff to the rear carrier using its own straps, and put the
bungees on just as a bit extra support.  What I was carrying was *not*
anything sizeable by any stretch (pardon the pun) of the imagination,
merely a small package.  3 miles later the bungees had stretched badly and
had the elastic properties of something not very elastic.  Now the damn
things won't hold themselves to the carrier...
<BR>
Anyone else had this problem?
<UL>
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Martin Whitfield, Apr 98:</EM><BR>
No, it sounds as if you have some dodgy bungees. Mine (on two Bromptons
over very long distances - one is five-years-old) have showed signs of
stress when stretched over very large objects, but have bounced back to
life in a couple of days. They are replaceable so I'd ask for some more.

The rear carrier will carry 1 average size adult - say 70Kg.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Stein Somers, Aug 2000:</EM><BR>
Hmm... I've seen you abduct Linette Chiang at Folder Forum III, but I
bet she's under 50kg.  A girl who cannot weigh more than 70kg (I
couldn't ask, obviously) once placed her foot on mine, without fully
standing on it, and already one of the stays broke.  I broke once of the
four bars by misplacing my foot while the bike was folded.

using the rear rack means you have to pedal with your heels or they
can bump against what you are carrying... small irritant in an otherwise
fine object...
<UL>
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Channell Wasson:</EM><BR>
If one is
carrying a box or bag on the rack, the load generaly comes sliding
forward so that one's heels hit the load on the rack.  Quite an anoyance!
Therefore it is important to adjust the rack load so that it does not
cover the last two inches of the rack nearest the seat post.  To
accomplish this I have installed two small plastic T fittings (1/4 or
3/8ths id) [T fittings are plumbing or conduit 90 degree tees]
secured to the rails of the rack with zip ties.  When
carrying a load I simply turn the fittings up so that the rack load can
not come forward.  A simple light weight solution that works like a
charm.  Another tip is to run the stretch rubber lines (elastic shock
cord assembly) under the rack.  When using them they can be pulled up
from inside the rack.  This will also help prevent the load from moving
forward.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Custfold, Nov 1997:</EM><BR>
The rear rack does work
if you have small feet, with the Brompton front pannier placed with pockets
facing down, either side of the rack, and well to the rear.  alternatively
the 4 litre panniers I have sit clear of my size 10 feet, hooked right at the
back of the rack, and no further forward than the axle.  If I could get the
right glue I've a watertight floation/stuff bag from a canoe, which will clip
onto the seatpost, and hold around 40 litres, and others have used roll stuff
sacs up to 9" diameter sitting vertically.

<UL>
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Andrew Henry:</EM><BR>
Its quite a lot of hassle to add the rack from an T5 to an L5.  The
rear mudguard and the front mudguard stay have to be changed.  A
dealer can order all these bits from Brompton, but they certainly
wouldn't keep them in stock.  If you want the rear rack, its
probably cheaper to buy a T5 and remove the dynamo.  Its certainly
less hassle for your Brompton dealer.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Channell Wasson:</EM><BR>
Racks are available as an after market item, but the are tricky and
time consumming to instal.  The fender must also be changed in the
process and the brake assembly must be readjusted.  It takes over an
hour to do the job.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Custfold, Jan 1998:</EM><BR>
The rack fitted to the Raleigh 20 (available as a spare can be fitted to the
Brompton but will require butchery and extra bits made - it will be less rigid
(only 1 set of stays) and will not incorporate the means of wheeling/and
parking which the standard rack offers.  The conversion kit is expensive
because you get the proper mudguard (different between T & L) and the
elastics, rollers etc on the rack.  It's worth the money - but note that the
lights and dynamo are not supplied - but the D Toplight Standlicht makes a
much neater job of a rear light & reflector set than the 2 pieces used as OEM
kit (and it stays on when you stop)
<BR>
We make the D Toplight up with a bracket to fit the T type rack as a kit.

Many years ago, thinking like many others that the Brompton rack was on
the pricey side, I set to work with an oxy-acetelene torch, an old
toasting rack and two Hillman Imp (that's Sunbeam in the US) battery
mounting stays and built a serviceable rack. It's lighter than the kosher
job, much cheaper, has little wheels to drag it around on, and it looks
horrible. If anyone should want to inspect it closely (why?), it's on
Jane's Number One Brompton - still giving good service after five years.

[...] waiting for some new struts for
the rear rack. Two have broken and Brompton want to sell me a new rack
rather than just the struts (which they buy in). When I buy a bike for
that price from a small manufacturer I expect to be able to get spare
parts for it.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Custfold, Jan 2000:</EM><BR>
I needed longer struts for the Nexus 7 conversion, as the old ones are too
short to reach the widened rear end.  I took off both the old ones and fitted
one new strut made from 1/2" U section aluminium which had the ends drilled to
take 4mm bolts in place of the rivets, and slotted out to clear the casting
web and the drop out stamping.

<LI><EM CLASS="from">Channell Wasson:</EM><BR>
I have worked out
two solutions.  I have a double deck rack system for rear of Brompton.
I use a Moulton Model 20 APB rack raised 2 feet above the Brompton
rack.This rack is available from Bromptonite Roger Grigsby of Santa
Cruz, California.  A clamp I had made grips the seat post and a strut
(Moulton strut) goes from rear of Moulton rack to nut on seat post quick
release fitting. This is a wide and ample rack which was designed to
carry the Moulton suitcase.  Now on the Brompton bottom rack I have
attached an 18 inch diameter circular barbeque lightweight grill.  It is
just the right size to support my Moulton canvas suitcase.  The rack is
quite sturdy enough and as a bonus it is chrome plated and I think looks
mysteriously smart. Loaded racks do eliminate the rear wheel fold under
feature of the Brompton.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">gert de jong, Aug 1997:</EM><BR>
I'd like to mount Karrimor front/rear panniers on the
Brompton rear carrier. I have an old version Brompton
with the steel rear carrier instead of the alu carrier
fitted nowadays.
<BR>
The (only ?) good thing about the steel carrier is that
the diameter of the steel bars are is in correspondence
with the clamps of the Karrimor panniers. The remaining
question is: how do I keep the panniers away from the
hub bolts and gear control chain(s)?
<BR>
Refraining from doing so causes excessive wear on the
panniers where they rest on the bolts and makes changing
gears difficult.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Chris Eacock, Jun 1998:</EM><BR>
[...] use one of
the racks that clamp-on to the seat post.  This would be placed high
enough to install panners and be clear of one's heels.  I have the Topeak
model (with a quick-release).
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Scoman, Aug 1999:</EM><BR>
I use one of these [Top Peak Luggage Rack offered by
Brompton USA] occasionally for my L5.  When I attach it to the seat post
and slide it down just right, I can attach full size ortlieb panniers.  The
top hooks clip onto the luggage rack, and the bottom hook slides right into
one of the stays that hold on the rear fender.  Works great for when you want
to carry some extra stuff.

Took 100 Primos to the carrier today for a shop delivery, and used the
Brompton, with the large carrier rack.  Total on front c.25Kg - bit of a pig
to handle with load extending so far forward, but otherwise OK.  Speed
limited by load swinging around rather than total load.

<IMG ALIGN="left" HSPACE=5 VSPACE=3 SRC="../pictures/Luggage2.jpg">
We shop with our bikes - and the local Somerfield is especially bike friendly.
Normally (must fix the bracket) I go down to the shop with the front carrier
rack (large size with 20cm supports) empty.  On arriving I place a store
basket on the rack - which it could have been made for - the fit is so good.
I place shopping in the store basket just like any other customer - except I'm
not burdened with the weight.  If it is a very large shopping I might put a
basket on the T type rack but it needs to be tied on (elastics) or carefully
balanced.
<BR>
Once we have finished we take a walk past the fresh fruit island, and pick out
a grape, tomato, melon, orange, or apples box of the nice stacking cardboard
variety, or if it really is a big shopping 2 or 3 of these.  The box is tied
on to the front rack, and the shopping loaded, if a second box is needed the
stacking system helps to locate it.  2 apple boxes is usually a weeks shopping
for us, and pushes the limit well over the recommended 16Kg for the front
carrier bracket.
<BR>
We usually find plenty of uses for the boxes once we get home as stacking
filing trays or tool boxes - even Brompton spares (16" tyres fit into apple
boxes just nicely).
Here is a picture of the system carrying home
the filing system (8 tomato boxes stacked on the front).
<BR>
Racks are &pound;24 and &pound;26 for 6" and  8" support sizes.
<BR>
We've also made a bag which takes the store basket inside, and you then take
the basket out and load the bag.  The ubiquitous Newspaper sack on the
Brompton frame is also a very cheap option for those who whinge about spending
money on anything!

I used to shop at Rainbow all the time (I assume you are referring to the
S.F. store by that name), in the old days, before the big move -- how weird
to hear about that new rule! Well, I designed and made a couple of huge
front bags that hold two grocery bags each and we shop with them all the
time (Real Foods, Whole Foods and Mollie Stone's). We usually fold up the
Bromptons and stick them in a shopping cart (trolley for you Brits!),

<H2><A NAME="front_carrier_block"></A>The Brompton front carrier block</H2>
A standard Brompton accessory to easily mount the cloth pannier
or shopping bag.
<UL>
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Channell Wasson:</EM><BR>
The carrier block seem very sturdy and I can only say I have often
carried 10 to 15 kg in the pannier or basket.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Doug Faunt:</EM><BR>
A bit of anecdotal evidence about the strength of the front block.  I
broke mine, by "tripping up" the front wheel in a cross rut when
riding very slowly on a cowpath, and going headover.  The block broke,
and the carrier frame bent slightly, because I went over the front,
and my whole 180 pound weight was pushing the right hand end of the
frame.
<BR>
I have been unable to straighten out the frame using simple
techniques, which means it wasn't easy to bend, and seems to indicate
that the block is quite strong.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Phil Gough:</EM><BR>
I and someone else mentioned the mounting of Samsonite-type
briefcases, when filled with the usual clutter the weight upon the
mounting block was I should think up to 15 pounds.  In over 8 years of
daily use the only effect this had on the block was for the mounting
screws to loosen, this happened twice only. This could be because the
case being rigid and taller than the Brompton bag vibrated and rattled
a lot.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Custfold:</EM><BR>
I have carried considerable unknown loads, on the front block, and equally
experienced screw loosening.  As an insurance I cut a slot, and threaded a
jubilee clip [for Americans: hose clamp] through the block, and around
the back of the head tube - result
less frequent loosening.  The critical issue is not I expect the total load,
but the moment forces from a wide load swinging from side to side, the block
happily took a 56lb weight in the child seat, for testing, but made the bike
heavy to steer.

Its moderately weather-proof. [...]
The metal handle can be a bit cold in the winter, so I wrapped
it in tape.  The balance of the bag is fine.  The only problem
with it is that the handle is a little narrow, so it can dig
into your hand if you carry a lot of weight in it (ie fill it
full of books).  Of course if you have your Brompton with you,
and you need to carry it for a long way, then you can unfold
the bike and clip it onto that.  Overall, though I don't find
it a problem to carry.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Dave Lyons:</EM><BR>
It is much easier to carry fully laden with a shoulder strap fitted on the
red loops on the top.  With the corner pockets facing inwards (towards you)
the bag is comfortable and does not slide around.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Custfold:</EM><BR>
There is a solution to the waterproofing of the front pannier bag available
now and potentially free.  Just ambush the local paperboy/girl and hijack the
excellent plasticised sack in which the papers are carried.  Turn this upside
down, and it will slip over the Brompton pannier almost perfectly.  The top
flap can be either tucked up, fitted with velcro tags to connect onto the
rear, or the shoulder strap shortened to hold it up under the Brompton
Pannier rack.  All of these allow the pannier to be detached without removing
the rain protection.
<BR>
These bags come in excellent bright orange or yellow colours, and if you find
reading the name of a local paper upside down, as you ride, a nuisance, then
a couple of good hot wash cycles usually cleans the bag spotless of print and
all but the worst tar spots.
<BR>
Custom Folder does have a source for these bags, but there is a minimum order
quantity, so let me know if you want one and don't wish to mug the news

While on the subject of Jane Henshaw's bag products, may I recommend her
waterproof front bag cover.
<BR>
I was surveying a map for Leicester during the two wettest days of the
year (Thursday and Good Friday) of Easter week, when rivers were rising
and floods were everywhere. Not a drip penetrated my Brompton bag and its
contents. Maps, being paper products, are particularly sensitive to water
and they were dry as a bone. Head to foot Gortex helped me keep dry too,
but my shoes were soaked and I could pour water out of them.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Channell Wasson, Oct 1998:</EM><BR>
If you want to be waterproofed in the front pannier area, then get
on of Jane Henshaw's pannier covers.  They slip over the entire pannier
assembly.  They are of waterproof fabric and come with sealed seams.
They look very good to me. Contact her at A2B Magazine.

<LI><EM CLASS="from">Rob Cope, Oct 1998:</EM><BR>
Since some of its shortcomings have come up for discussion:
<BR>
I am rather disappointed with the details of this. It is a fairly expensive
bag made principally of high-grade Cordura but to my mind shows definite
"spoil a ship for a ha'perth of tar" characteristics.
<BR>
It is never going to be totally waterproof, but could be a great deal better
if the flap over all 3 zips was extended by about 2 cm & possibly fastened
down eg with Velcro.  The present short flaps do little to prevent water
seepage via the zips (which on mine are pretty poor quality: I trust
Carradice now specifies better zips).  It would also help if the base was
not pop-riveted right where road-splash is likely to hit.
<BR>
The 2 loops are useful, but are fixed to the bag, not the frame, so should
be used with caution if contents are heavy or precious.

It really is about time it got some reflectors fitted as standard: you can
buy stick-on tape etc but Cordura is hard to stick things to.  Carradice
used to do the bag to order in non-standard colours: is there such a thing
as a retroreflective Cordura?
<BR>
The materials are good & Carradice does offer an excellent repairs service.
But I do think the design is in dire need of updating.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Willi Mindak, Oct 98:</EM><BR>
All valid points.
While we're re- designing the bag: couldn't it be made bigger?
I believe in increase in depth would be problematical because the bike's handling
may be affected.
But an increase in height (and possibly in width) is possible, even if it were
only a couple of inches.
In addition to that 2 adjustable loops with quick releases should be added to the flap,
so that it's possible to tie an additional item (i.e. waterproof jacket) 'rucksack style'
to it.

I used the Pannier system regularly.  It works great on the bike, but
it's a bit heavy to lug around museums etc, and the aluminum frame digs into
you and innocent bystanders.  But I found it to be an absolute necessity for
day trips outside of Paris.  We would leave our apartment in the shadow of
the Eiffel Tower, bike up to Gare Nord, fold up the bikes, hop on the train
to Chantilly, and bike up to the medieval village of Senlis.  In our
Panniers:  Water, sweaters, maps, tire kits, a book, binoculars, camera,
sunscreen etc.

I've had the bag leak for me.  The leaks really seem
to start when enough water starts to pile up on the
top of the bag.  Once this happens the fabric becomes
saturated and water eventually goes through.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Rob Cope, Dec 1999:</EM><BR>
This is usually the stitching, more than the zip leaking  (though better
flaps covering the zips would not go amiss).   Use the sort of
sealer camping shops sell for tents etc (tube better than spray).  Helps
a lot (not as much as a cover though).

Actually you can make it almost waterproof with a tube of Grainger's
liquid seam sealant (or similar)- I found most of the leakage was
through the top seam, not the zip. A liberal application of
aformentioned seam sealant to all exposed seams made a vast improvement.

<LI><EM CLASS="from">Graham A. Patterson:</EM><BR>
I have used a Karrimor rackpak on the rear carrier with success when
touring. I strapped two rucksac pockets on the outside for extra capacity,
which meant that I had to secure it well back, level with the rear brake.
It was secured by running the two carrier bungee cords over the top. The
rackpak has shoulder straps. The capacity is similar to the Brompton
pannier, but less flexible in use because of the shape.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Andrew Mackay, the red flash around London's round-a-bouts:</EM><BR>
You don't need a front carrier system at all on a Brompton.
<BR>
I have used a simple small "back-pack" that cost &pound;9.99 and can be found in
most luggage shops.  They all have a loop at the top to hold them like a
suit-case.  You'll find, if you loop this over the tip of the saddle and
then push it around to the back of the bike, that it is very firmly fixed
by the weight of the bag.  You have to sit on the loop but this is not too
bad.  The only addition you need is to sew a velcro band to the Zip side of
the bag to stop it moving sideways or forwards away from the seat pillar
when you brake or pedal.  You need to have the bag orientated so that the
side that would normally be on your back points backwards from the bike to
lessen the stresses on the zips.  This technique utilises the empty space
available because the Brompton has small wheels and is so foldable.  On
arrival you undo the velcro, slip the bag round & forwards and it comes off
very conveniently.  You could use any size of bag you wanted provided the
loop is the correct size for your saddle (a soft saddle cover helps).

[ There was a letter in the Folder a

On the subject of front carriers, I recently bought a extra frame for use on
my partners Brompton and my own.  I have attached to it a large 30L capacity
white plastic coated freezer basket which I found lying in the street.  The
basket is secured to the frame by 3 medium sized cable ties and when I tried
it out for the first time it worked perfectly.  I used to secure this basket
to the rear rack, but no more.  I feel quite smug waiting at the checkout
with the basket full of groceries on the parked Brompton.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Philip Hall, Oct 1997:</EM><BR>
I have a Neobike (Taiwanese) Brompton. I'm told it does not fit the
front carrier block and, anyway, I already have lots of bicycle luggage
so I have fitted a small aluminum bar along the lower part of the
handlebars. This luggage bar has a notch cut for the handlebar-mounting
bolt so that it essential sits on this mounting bolt and is held level
by two nylon straps.
<BR>
The point of this is that I can mount an ordinary bike pannier across
the front of the bike. I can even put a large soft motorcycle pannier
and still have room for my headlight mounted above the front wheel.
<BR>
It works great! There are two problems to be aware of: I'm not sure of
the strength of the tall steering stem so I am leery of overloading the
bag. The second problem follows the first: it is easy to put heavy loads
in big bags and regret it later. One must still remember to put v.heavy
things on the rear rack.
<BR>
However, for taking my lunch and raingear to work it is excellent.
<UL>
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Custfold, Nov 1997:</EM><BR>
There are 3 problems - most delivery bikes have the load carrying basket
attached securely to the main frame, thus keeping the weight evenly
distributed.  The Brompton design of carrying system is very well designed in
this respect, as it has the load secure, over the front wheel, and not
swinging about with handlebar movement, which becuase of the bike's design is
more pronounced than a conventional bike in effect when a load is carried on
the bars.
<BR>
One option (IIRC the Neobike uses a small diameter steerer (1" not 1.125" as
the current Brompton) so you could get a Brompton front frame section -
possibly one which has been damaged in a crash, and cut off the main tube to
leave a unit which will slip over the 1" head tube, and with a small slot cut
in it can be squeezed up around the existing head tube, or buy one of Tim
Whitty's adaptor plates and clamp it on with 'Jubilee' (aka hose) clips -
some day we'll educate those US mechanics into the proper nomenclature for
parts, or sell them an English-American dictionary. :-))

the rear axle - thus clearing all but the biggest plates of meat (plates if

We have a couple of very large home-made bags and brackets that we use on
our Bromptons. They weigh much less than the Brompton bag and frame, cost
much less, and carry up to 30lbs (13.6kg) quite regularly. They've now
survived for four years without mishap, including many off-road miles and
one journey (part off-road) of 70 miles. I just wish someone would put
something similar into production...
I've never heard of a pannier or bracket failure, but I would not
recommend exceeding 30lbs, because the bike's handling begins to get a
bit sticky at that point.

We now have models of a shoulder carried bag for the Brompton, a large front
bag - which is designed to take a supermarket shopping basket sitting inside,
but will pack away flat when removed from Brompton carrier rack, plus a
waterproof bag - which may have some minor dimensional adjustments to
accommodate speed skates for the Dutch market with 50cm blades.  All in true
Henry Ford colour scheme, with nice matt external finish (it's Jo's fashion
background I reckon).
<BR>
I've sorted out the 4 litre pannier fixings for sides and top of the rack -
it's now just a question of making the brackets look a bit more respectable,
and likewise the V brake mounting system for L & T models, it works but could
look nicer.  V brakes are hot stoppers though.  Note that the front bag is
pocket less, but we may fit the mountings for the 4 litre panniers in the
appropriate places to attach a set in front also.

For the minimalist we also have a shoulder strap and attachmants to carry
naked Bromptons around which is coming along nicely.

The same bag might also fit the front carrier, but we have a compromise of a
bag with proper seams (the Brompton ones are a bit basic, and it leaks here
first) and seal this with the Voyageur seal bar making the bag almost airtight -
like the sealed seam OEM flotation luggage mentioned at start.  A further
option is to mount the York 80 box on the front carrier - a box designed by
Joel York for Voyageur (?) to float with 80 lbs of payload, and in polymer
casting with neoprene seal ISTR around $70 or $80 retail price.  It can carry

In designing our bag, with the slide seal on the top Josephine used her 20
years in fashion & clothing design to make a more waterproof seam (and with
the right material we could make the bag in a welded seam as the canoe luggage
we have brought in uses) to make bags which carry clothing and double up as
bouyancy because they are airtight.  Our bags are 'airtight enough to make a
bouncy balloon, but without a fully sealed seam they do leak slowly down.  The
material is a coated Nylon which comes in an attractive Ford Black or to
special order in other colours.  We also make a carrying sack fro the Brompton
which goes over the shopulder like a posties bag.
<BR>
For a low cost option in 2 guises consider buying a news delivery bag from the
local paper publishers - these are a coarse but HD nylon coated in PVC -
usually bright orange or yellow.  A couple of boil washes in strong detergent
should remove any printing from the bag and make it 'very' clean.  Prices vary -
if you're a good bargain hunter - free or bribe the paper boy/pay around
&pound;3-&pound;5 for a new one from the paper distribution centre
<BR>
Option 1 - buy a Brompton pannier frame - fit plastic stiffener sheet to
back/front and bottom of the bag (glue - pop rivet etc).  With webbing straps
or other fixings attach bag to frame and voila a bright coloured front pannier -
a bit short usually on the front flap, but fitted backwards it presents a 1
piece face to the oncoming water.
<BR>
Option 2 - you have a Brompton pannier - invert the bag - rear of bag to front
of pannier and slide down over the pannier, bringing the top (now bottom) flap
back to cover the underside.  With either 2 velcro straps fitted to hitch this
flap up to the rear, or using the strap attached to the bag pulled tight, keep
the flap up clear of light and wheel.
<BR>
This has an added bonus - most news delivery bags are just big enough to fit
an L type Brompton inside and use as the carry system - our sack is just a
slightly larger version with some luxury extras (long flap, detachable strap
that can be used without the bag etc).

I have been using the Brompton bag for 3 years.
But it is now heavily worn so I decided to by a Velo case.
This is an Rimova aluminium case pictured in the first or second encyclopedia.
It has about the same capacity like the Brompton bag and has a quick release system
that allows to fix the Case to the Brompton frame.
Onle problem is that jou have to remove the frame to allow the case to be fully opened.
I wish I had another frame without the preshaped handle (to facilitate opening)
and without the bottom bracket (to avoid damage to the bottom of the case.

As it is a hard case it is very robust and it is waterproof.

There is a little (essential) play in the system: as the block wears
slightly this play can increase, sometimes enough for the sprung tongue to
escape the matching rebate in the bag frame. The solution is to make the
tongue stick out further.  Do not try bending it... SNAP! Unscrew it (keep
hold of screw & washer) & sand down the back at a slight angle: enough to
increase the angle of the tongue (rotary sander with fine paper helps -
but careful now, you only need take a little off).
Reassemble & problem should be gone: bag will snap into place reassuringly
like it used to.  Dave Henshaw is the expert on this.
<BR>
BTW  I find the allen bolts holding the block on slacken fairly quickly:
annoying, as the tongue then has to come out (cheesehead selftap screw -
would a matching allen bolt cost much more?) before the allens can be
tightened.  Solution: a smear of locking paste applied at factory or by
dealers?

There is a difference of opinion on this list on whether you can take a
laptop or not. I think it's a matter of the risk you want to take,
considering the following aspects :
1. The quality of your laptop
2. The ownership : is it your own or your employers laptop ?
3. How often you make backups
I have a Toshiba, owned by my employer, and I make backups often. Besides,
I don't want to commute (I have to change train/tram a lot) with a Brompton

So, taking all this in account, I take the risk (is there is a risk).

I also have this great saddlebag (yes, it hangs from my saddle)
made by Carradice in England, called the Camper Longflap, & it is HUGE, with
just two of these you could go on a loaded tour! This saddlebag is one of the
coolest, most useful bike items I've owned. The Rivendell Bicycle Works
catalog writes about them, "Carradice saddlebags are so unfashionable, people
you don't even know will ask you about them. Even other cyclists!" BTW,
Carradice also makes the basket for the Brompton & they go well together.
<BR>
Carradice makes
several wonderful saddlebags out of heavy cotton duck with thick leather
straps. They are the traditional saddlebags that have been made for a long
time. They are not quick release (quite the opposite), but the seat can be
almost fully collapsed just by unfastening one buckle around the seatpost.
The straps are not sewn on the bag & may be removed & replaced with quick
release straps if thats what you want. I have the Camper Longflap which is
HUGE, but my catalog (Rivendell Bicycle Works) lists two smaller models also.
I bought mine mostly because I love high quality traditional stuff like this
& it has turned out to be very useful
<P>{Malcolm Lyon}
Yes, I also use the Camper model it is big and will last for lifetime .. but
you will realise that whilst the fabric is water and bullet proof the design
does not exclude water from the flap edges. It is important to put clothes
in a plastic bag and use the saddle bag as a sort of compression bag!
<BR>
Readers around the world may be interested to know that these Carradice bags
are used widely by members of the British Cyclists Touring Club and more or
less 'de rigueur' for well dressed CTC bike!
<BR>
The leather straps a bit tedious to unbuckle.  And there has been a chap
selling a very nice quickly detachable saddle fitting - I don't recall his
name [...]. The fitting is well made in
anodised aluminium and would not restrict the folding of a Brompton.  He
also makes an uplift version for conventional bikes where the saddle is
close to the rear mudguard.
I can identify the source for these if requested.
<BR>
I have said they are very easy for practical person to make and require only
a short length of ally strip a piece of dowel rod and an old QR hub skewer.
Difficult to describe in words but I am happy to send a sketch by fax to
anyone interested in making one.  Or I could perhaps scan a tif file to
attach to an email .. but I have not tried this on my computer.
<P>
This months [april 97] issue of the CTC magazine features on page 41 the Kwiklift
attachment for the Carradice bags.  This is ideal for folders as it enables
the bag to be rapidly removed when the bike is folded.  It comes in two
versions.  17 pounds for the basic bracket plus another 10 pounds for the
additional bag support which may add some stability to the bag but is really
designed to eliminate pressure on the mudguard of a big wheel bike.

Fill it so as to avoid the bag bulging too wide,
and simply hook both handles over the back of the seat.
If the handles don't fit over the back of the seat,
the hand-holes can be torn/cut downwards as necessary.
<BR>
The handles being thin plastic have no effect on comfort;
Once the bag is correctly aligned it tends to remain so.
I have my seat pointing down quite a lot at the front anyway
but I doubt this is essential.
<BR>
Specifications:
<BR>
(A) Functionality:
<BR>
Safe load: probably about 1kg per nested bag for extended use,
rather more for short trips on good roads from the supermarket.
<BR>
Typical dimensions: w 160  l 320  h 350   (c. 18 litres)
...depending on how you fill the bag, which adjusts to contents.
<BR>
(B) Costs:
<BR>
Weight: c. 11g per bag
<BR>
Folded size: c. 20cc (various shapes), air excluded fairly well.
<BR>
Money: nil.
<BR>
Acquisition hassle: negligible.
<BR>
(C) Available colours/styles:
<BR>
Lots. For those who prefer not to advertise, many small shops
use anonymous bags of this type, in various colours/designs.
<BR>
... pretty hard to beat? OK, arguably it can look cheap...
<BR>
With apologies people who make or sell seat bags.

Have used a Super C saddlebag its fine you can fold the bike and leave the
saddlebag on Make sure your saddle bag loops on your saddle are sturdy. Mine
got broken by a baggage handler picking the bike up by the saddle bag. The
seatpin is designed to take a big load so a saddlebag is fine. I do a have
an uplift but I haven't fitted it yet heavy duty bit of kit.

Is there a safe and simple way to use baby-seats for bikes on a Brompton?
<UL>
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Immanuel Burton, Aug 1997:</EM><BR>
If the young child to be carried is small enough, then you could do what I
once saw on a  Brompton - the child was sitting sideways on the rear
carrier, and as his legs were short enough, his feet did not drag along on
the ground.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Dave Horne, Aug 1997:</EM><BR>
I've only had my Brompton for about a month or so, but think it would be
wiser to have the child (a small child) sit up front.  Once I started from
a complete stop (how else &lt;g&gt;), and the front end of the bike came up.  I
would bet that the center of gravity is well in the back of the bike and
having a child in the front would make more sense and be a bit safer.

I have adapted a Dutch baby seat, designed for quick release from a frame
mounted plate, to fit the Brompton front carrier.
<BR>
The frame mounted block (extra weight) is replaced with an adaptor to fit the
Brompton block.  The 15Kg proposed limit for front mounted child seats, is
well withing the capacity of the Brompton block (IME I have exceeded this
many times).
<BR>
We have tested the seat with a 56lb weight (25Kg) riding around farm tracks.
On these tests the steering was noticably heavier, but not unpredictable.
Andrew Holland has a first production model, and the price is currently
coming in at #65.00, subject to the pound's fluctuations.  The Holland family
were trying out the prototype model at Weymouth in May, and apart from some
retraining of the hand signalling assistant found the seat worked well.
<BR>
Mounting the load on the frame, and with main weight approximately over the
front axle is almost identical in principle to the delivery/postal bike.  The
front block is designed to take extra load, and takes it low down, keeping
c.g. and balance in trim.
<BR>
Other options with the unmodified version of the seat, are to mount it on the
steering tube (facing forwards) - which so9me Dutch users claim is OK, or the
seat post, as happens with conventional bikes.  This latter is likely to foul
the back of your thighs on a B, and put extra bending load onto the seatpost -
see my notes on 'How I bent my seatpost' by 6'6" 200lb weakling.  Both the
last 2 also require a clamp fitting, and may affect folding.
<BR>
If demand is sufficient we may be able to get ther seats in kit form, rather
than the tedious process of dismantling and converting the bracket, and
reassembly.  Bulk purchase may also help us to keep the costs down, and
perhaps make the seat available directly from a local shop, rather than a
special item.
<BR>
I'll put a photo in with the price lists which I've finally got finished,
only to change again no doubt!

I have seen a rearward facing child seat attached to the front of a
Brompton. I didn't look to see how it was fastened, but assume the
post holding the seat was screwed onto the luggage mounting.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Custfold, Nov 1997:</EM><BR>
The proprietor of Griffon Alternative Cycles noted to me that he'd seen
'competition' for the child seat on a Brompton design
<BR>
I saw a Brompton with a child seat a few days ago. It had long rails which
ended in a large plastic clamp which fitted onto the seat tube.
<BR>
I'm wary of seats on Brompton Seatpost, due to the interference with folding
(sliding post down) and extra moment loading on the seatpost which will thus
bend more, potentially to deform permanently - loading the front block,
designed, and IIRC tested to considerable loadings, with lower center
of gravity is IMO (perhaps slightly biased) a better option.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Custfold, Apr 1998:</EM><BR>
Drop me an sae and I'll send a picture of the seat made for Andrew Holland and
others, it fits the front carrier block and is rated by the manufacturer for
kids up to 15 Kg,  we rode it with a 56lb (24Kg approx) weight in around farm
tracks and it held up ok - but Brompton advised max weight for the block is
16Kg.
<BR>
The seat is a modified version of a Dutch seat which fits the front stem or
rear of seatpost with a pair of prongs into a socket bolted onto the frame
tubes - spare mounting brackets can be fitted to different bikes.  I have one
unmodified unit left at present.
<UL>
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Simon Risley, Nov 1998:</EM><BR>
I first came across the seat - an adaptation of a Dutch seat called a Bobike
Mini - when I bumped into Andrew Holland and his son at London Zoo.  Andrew
kindly sent me details of how to get one, and I put in an order to Dave (his
e-mail address is "custfold@aol.com").
<BR>
I have been very pleased with it and regularly use it to transport my two year
old, Olivia, around London.  She loves it.  I have also - rather tentatively -
taken my four year old out on the seat, too, but she is as tall as many six
year olds, so I don't do it too often because of the heavy loading that it
puts on the Brompton front carrier block.
<BR>
The seat is very dinky: it doesn't look at all out of proportion to the bike,
but carries Olivia perfectly adequately. and is padded.  I think that the
rear-facing configuration is good from the point opf view of cutting down on
the wind-chill factor and at the same time allowing the rider to interact with
his/her child.
<BR>
The legs are adjustable to 3 different lengths, and there are neat elasticated
foot-retaining straps.
<BR>
My only criticism is that the seat would be greatly improved if there was a
headrest - particularly useful with smaller children whose necks aren't as
strong as an adults. I've corresponded with Dave about this and he suggests a
home made rest made with jubilee clips and a strip of neoprene or somesuch,
but I'm not terribly enthused at its probable appearance!  I would like to fax
Bobike to see if they make a headrest, as the top of ythe seat has holes that
would seem to indicate this as an option.  However, I cannot get their fax
number (it is on the seat itself but is unreadable on mine!)  Any info on this
gratefully received!
<BR>
If anyone would like to look at it - or would like any further information -
just e-mail me on "simongikuk@aol.com" and I'll try and arrange a time.  I
live in Shepherd's Bush - which is W12, not W14 as stated on the Website.

Oh - I thought I'd suggested a sheet of clear Lexan with Bulldog Clips
(Translation required here) which if fitted to the curve of the seat back
would serve a double purpose as a clear fairing for the adult rider, at the
same time.  One drawbach though is that the seat does neatly sit over the
folded Brompton (seat facing down) and a fairing (unless detachable) would
make this too big for the folded package.

How I did it in Amsterdam:
<BR>
Baby (I think she was about 3 weeks old): in a baby-carrier on my
breast, baby's feet under my coat, its head (like yours) in the open
air (important because you generate a lot of heat!), baby looking
outwards.
<BR>
From when she was about 12 months: normally available child seat that
fits into a block that I attached to my Brompton.
The block looks a bit like (see below). It is 'U'-shaped, and quite
strong, and wide enough to go around the big tube.
The seat has pins that go into the holes. The block is available
separately, so you can attach one to each bike you have.

Before I describe my child seat solution, I want to state that it is
not an endorsed Brompton Solution. Use this suggestion at your own risk and
peril. CAVEAT Brompton fan!
<BR>
I suggest using the Brompton basket mounted on Carrier Block with a
couple of holes cut out of front of basket and then properly stiched and
reinforced for comfort of the child.  Then place padding under and at back
of child.  The kid rider loves being up front and there you can keep any eye
on the little darling! For redundent safety measures place a strap through
handle of basket and around handle bars in case carrier block starts to go.
Don't try it over a 20 kg (40lb) load.  A very unauthorized solution, but it
has produced great joy for both riders--especially with our dog Bromie
running along side.  Shortly I will have photos of this solution in Current
Events Photo Gallery on <A HREF="http://www.foldabikes.com">our Brompton web site</A>.

A2B issue14 deals pretty comprehensively with methods of conveying children,
our Child seat conversion unit uses a proprietary model of child seat rated
for children weighing up to 15Kg - This is modified to clip directly on to
the front block, putting the child's weight in by far the most stable and
least stressed position (on a seatpost the child seat will put weight outside
the wheelbase of the bike (wheelies more likely - as experienced on
Bickertons and Micros) and put extra loading on the seatpost to bend it
rearwards, my 95KG plus small rucksack did this until I fitted thick wall s/s
tube and built the first extending seatpost.  The child will also get a very
close view of the rider's rear end (the seats are usually set further back on
conventional bikes) - The seatpost will also need to have the child seat
fittings removed to fully fold the bike.
<BR>
Brompton used to suggest a maximum load of 16Kg on the front block but have
downrated this to 10 Kg,  This conservative figure reflects the problem with
panniers which are loaded to provide large swinging moment forces on the 2,
4mm set screws which will loosen and occasionally shear if allowed to remain
loose.  I fit a secondary system to all my blocks which acts as an insurance,
but when carrying children this way you are strongly advised to keep th block
well secured.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Hans Langen, Feb 2000:</EM><BR>
I used the childseat made by Dave Holland for about 1,5 years. It worked great!
The child is sitting in front of you, facing you. So there is close contact and
you can easily watch your child and talk to it. Because the seat is in a low
position there is unrestricted view. The quick attachment to the front carrier
block makes it very easy to fold the bike and enter a bus with child, seat and
bike.
I always felt very safe although it needs a bit of practice to get the child in
the seat.

Now he is too heavy (2,5 years / 17kg) and a trailer will be the next step (have

My original 1989 front forks (about the only original bit on the bike) appear
to have given up the ghost - I'm wary about riding it with the trailer
(although the last trip -walked home with 70 sheets of hardboard (at least
150Kg)), once I get both brakes up to scratch.  The problem is that the forks
'knock' from side to side, suggesting that the steerer has fractured and the
steerer bolt &amp; wedge are the only things holding the whole lot together.  Not
bad considering that I've seen out at least 3 sets of frame units
(front/rear) and 4 or 5 rear triangles - interesting that the current rear
triangles seem to be lasting with no problem, now the pivot spindle must be
wearing more (going by the wear on previous exchanges).
