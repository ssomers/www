I use a Cat Eye type
"velo 2", on which I could enter the 130cm (...inches?) of the tyre
circumference. BUT: I had to solder a new piece of cable between the
computer and the sensor. I've strapped it to the set of cables that's
running from the handlebars to the rear triangle anyway, and mounted
the sensor on the horizontal part of the rear triangle, inside when
folded. It has been running without problem for 1458.0 kilometers since
then. Be careful to mount it "tilting forward" on the handlebars,
because if you don't, the button to change functions on the computer
(used for zeroing your trip total) will be the most outside point of
the folded package, causing the computer to zero at unwanted times
(eg. between chairs in trains). I hope you don't consider this
"jerrymandering"? Apart from the soldering, mounting was no problem
at all.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Richard Lighton, Nov 1998:</EM><BR>
I fitted an Avocet 15 to Arnold with only the minor problem of
having to change the position of the detector attached to the fork
because the first attempt interfered with the folding. It was
just another of those things that led me to curse, then admire
the ingenuity of the folding design. The battery powered light
has so far defeated me. That has to come off before folding.
(Another 10 seconds)
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Peter Holden, Nov 1998:</EM><BR>
I have an Avocet 15.  Works great.  No problem.  Just took time and care to
route the cable off the front tire, giving care where it bends.
The 16" wheel:  well, I've got mine set for 1285 (for miles); but you can set
yours simply bymeasuring the rolling circumference--roll the wheel a few times
with a load on it, then divide inches into miles or whatever the calculation
is. (its late, can't think) there are instructions in the packet.
the Avocet 15 is simple and gives me distance and speed on the same screen
(not all do)

I have mounted the Cateye Enduro 2 such that the folding and neatness of
cables is just fine on my Bromptons (mine and my wife's).  Can't say that
it's the best computer, because it's the only one I've ever had and it
has a maddening user interface.  But that may be true of all of them.  It
does time of day, speed, distance, average speed over a trip, whether
you're going over or under your average speed, etc etc etc.
<BR>
I had to replace one signal sending cable because I bent it too sharply
and tightened the plastic tie-down too much.

Harris Cyclery recommends that the magnet mounted on the front wheel spokes
be placed as close to the hub as possible, is this right?
<UL>
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Stein Somers, Jul 1999:</EM><BR>
Yes, there the (linear, not angular) velocity of the magnet is smallest,
so the sensor has more time to notice it passing by.  The sensor is not
a coil measuring a magnetic pulse.  At least the sensors I've openened
were Reed relays, small vaccum glass containers containing two tiny
metal plates that attract eachother while in the magnet's field, thus
establishing an electric contact monitored by the main unit.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">John Blackburn, Jul 1999:</EM><BR>
Reed relays can suffer from "contact bounce", which may lead to a double
pulse, giving twice the correct reading. But this is rare and could only
happen if the magnet is weak, or too far away, or the various fixing
screws haven't been tightened up properly.
<BR>
A cycle computer is usually a 4-bit microcontroller with built-in LCD
(liquid crystal display) driver, running from 3 volts (2 watch cells or
1 lithium) or 1.5 volts (1 cell, with voltage doulber for the LCD).
<BR>
One of its input pins is connected to the supply rail (eg +3 volts line)
via a high resistor (typically 3.3 megohms). The reed relay is connected
from this input pin to ground; when the relay closes the voltage on the
pin falls from +3 volts to zero. This change is detected, "debounced"
(rejecting multiple contact closures), and used by the built-in software
to calculate speed etc.
<BR>
A reed relay is used because it removes the need for an on-off switch.
The computer is always running (using a tiny current), and thus can
always detect if the reed contact closes, but the LCD is switched off
after a few minutes of inactivity to conserve the battery.
<BR>
If you leave the bike in such a position that the reed-relay is next to
the magnet, there is an extra battery drain because a small current
flows through the 3.3 megohm resistor.
<BR>
Example (measurement made by me, on a real cycle computer using a
Lithium battery):
Bike parked with reed-relay not near magnet: battery life estimated as 5
years.
Bike parked with reed-relay next to  magnet: battery life estimated as 3
years.
<BR>
In other words, it isn't very important, on this particular computer at
least.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Frank Abbing, Jul 1999:</EM><BR>
I once installed a magnet without my glasses on, that is at a 90 degree
angle from what it should be. This gave me a very stable double reading....

<H2><A NAME="137"></A>Wireless bicycle computer on a Brompton</H2>
<EM CLASS="from">Dave Horne, Aug 1997:</EM><BR>
Who makes a wireless that can work with 16" wheels?
<UL>
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Leonard Rubin, Aug 97:</EM><BR>
I have had good luck with the Sigma Sport BC 700. There are others as well,
and often, although the literature (table or chart) that comes with a unit
may only show figures down to 20", you find that you can, in fact, type in
a smaller rollout number yourself.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Norman Tulloch, Aug 1997:</EM><BR>
The Cateye Cordless 2 works fine, though the transmitter unit  isn't
altogether an ideal fit onto the Brompton's small front fork and I did have
some initial difficulty with getting it properly mounted.
<UL>
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Willi Mindak, Oct 97:</EM><BR>
[Cateye Cordless 2] does not work properly on the Brompton.
In the instructions that
came with the unit a max. distance of 45 cm between sensor and main unit
is given. Because of the Brompton's small wheels and long stem the
closest you can get is about 55 to 60 cm (with the main unit mounted on
the handlebar). For the cateye this distance is too long, and at best it
works intermittently.
<BR>
If the main unit is held a couple of inches closer to the transmitter,
everything works fine, but I feel that the only sensible location for
the main unit is on the handlebar in direct view of the rider.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Norman Tulloch, Oct 1997:</EM><BR>
Initially, I fitted the sensor unit on the front fork where its shape
seemed to fit the curve of the front fork best  -  that is, below the
mudguard stay.  The computer didn't work consistently and gave unreliable
readings.
<BR>
However, I then tried fitting it  above the mudguard stay and (somewhat to
my surprise) it worked just fine and has continued to do so.  The sensor
isn't the neatest fit in the world onto the front fork in this position,
and I used some black insulating tape (which doesn't look too horrible on
my black Brompton) to make it more secure.  Though I wasn't too confident
about this arrangement, it has given me no problems over 425 miles,
including quite a few rough roads.
<BR>
I should perhaps also have said that I have the computer itself mounted on
the lowest part of the handlebars, beside where they clamp onto the stem
<BR>
[...] on the Brompton the
distance between front fork and the lowest part of the handlebars is much
greater than on conventional bikes.  The Cateye instruction manual states,
"The distance between the sensor and the main unit must be kept within
45cm."  However, on the Brompton the best I can manage is about 55cms.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Nov 1997:</EM><BR>
[..] curiously enough it is now giving inconsistent
readings or none at all.  I tried replacing the batteries but this made no
difference.
<BR>
I strongly suspect that the problem is caused by the colder weather which
has now arrived.  Temperatures here in south-west Scotland are now around 45
degrees Fahrenheit during the day and it may be that this sort of
temperature is low enough to prevent the lithium batteries from working at
full efficiency.  Since it is not possible to obtain ideal positions for
mounting computer and transmitter units on the Brompton (because of the
distance between the front fork and handlebars), I guess that the units need
to be working at their best, and it may be that in winter temperatures this
does not occur.
<BR>
I have tried removing the computer from its mounting bracket on the
handlebars and holding it a few inches closer to the transmitter unit on the
front fork.  This seemed to cure the problem.  I think I shall have to adopt
Channell Wasson's solution of mounting the computer on the Brompton's frame
instead of on the handlebars -- at least until the warmer weather returns!

Lithium cells operate over a wide temperature range. Data sheets from
the main manufacturers (Sanyo, Saft, Varta and others) show that even
at -20 &deg;C, cells still have more than 60% of their room-temperature
capacity. Cell voltage is nominally 3 volts per cell, falling to 2.5
volts below -20 &deg;C. Capacity loss is as low as 1% per year in most
cells. At low temperatures, it is even better.
<P>
The very high cell voltage (at least 3 volts, and 3.6 volts in some
types) means that only one cell is needed in order to construct a
calculator (or bicycle computer) with LCD display. If a cycle computer
contains 2 cells, they are more likely to be silver-oxide cells, as used
in watches.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
I doubt if any cell or battery has a poor performance at 45 &deg;F as
claimed.

The attraction of the wireless
computer, as far as I was concerned, was that I felt the wire of a wired one
might get in the way when the bike was being folded, or that it would become
snagged or broken.  The wireless computer also looks just a bit neater, too.
However, it may well be that the wireless computer is more bother than it's
worth.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Willi Mindak, Oct 97:</EM><BR>
I've tried to mount the sensor unit as close to the main unit as
possible, that is above the mudguard stay on the right forkleg, and I
also tried the left forkleg (with the unit 'reversed' (in front of the
fork. The receiver was mounted as low as possible, next to the habdlebar
clamp. I got it working 'in the lab', but when out on the road I noticed
that the little blinking indicator was not pulsing at the same frequency
when at constant speed, so this arrangement did not work very well.
<BR>
If it works for you I'm going to try a new battery on the sensor (even
though the unit is brand new the battery may have suffered from long
storage.

The Sigma range (which has an optional wireless transmitter unit) also
works on 16" wheels.  However, cable ties are used for mounting both the
computer (to the handlebars) and the transmitter (to the front fork).  I
feel this is a fairly crude method of fixing which makes it difficult to
get the units securely attached.  The Sigma also looks a bit cheap, whereas
the Cateye is generally of better quality.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">David Cox, Nov 1997:</EM><BR>
Sigma wireless computers work up to 70cms.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Frank Abbing, Jun 1998:</EM><BR>
... the [Sigma 300 cycle computer's] cable IS long enough.
I installed the pickup device on the left leg of the front fork,
taped the cable to the front lamp cable up to the point where it does a V-turn.
From there I taped the computer cable to the rear brake cable.
I could pass the cable through the factory
installed cable guides by disassembling the slider contacts (undo two
extremely small screws). After the installation there is almost no slack
cable left, the bike folds and unfolds as it used to do. The Sigma 300 is
rather simple, with large figures. Good, because it is farther away than
usual, on the lower part of the handlebar. The computer protrudes about a
centimeter from the folded bike. Because it is mounted by a simple rubber
ring it just moves to a safe position if you hit something when carrying the
bike.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Willi Mindak, May 99:</EM><BR>
I returned three different computers, until I happened to stumble across the Sigma.
The range of the Sigma's wireless unit  is about 90 cm, so you can fit it almost anywhere on the handlebar.
You can use any computer from the Sigma range, because they sell the transmitter/ receiver for wireless operating seperately.
You can use the normal 'wired' sensor on your second bike.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">David Cox, May 1999:</EM><BR>
I've used wired computers on my Brompton with no particular problems

On a Bike Friday I have a wireless Sigma which is fine except when I pass
the big BBC Transmitter at Wychbold near Bromsgrove in Worcestershire
(Archer country for those who follow that radio soap !) The effect was to
momentarily halve the indicated speed and then cut out the reading. I did
some fiddling with the connections and magnet to no avail then less than a
mile later it reverted back to normal.

I've been using a Wireless Heart Rate Monitor on rides for a while

consideration.

At the risk of sounding really thick, does a front pannier full of stuff
inhibit a wireless computer ? It is 35 years since I did O level physics and
the empirical test would be a bit expensive.
<UL>
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Norman Tulloch, Aug 1997:</EM><BR>
Don't ask me about the physics of the matter, but in my experience a loaded
front pannier makes no difference to a wireless computer.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Leonard Rubin, Aug 97:</EM><BR>
If the elements used infared transmission to communicate (they don't) then
line-of-sight would be crucial; as I infer that they use RF (radio
frequency) communications, the only issue would be signal strength, which
must be, admittedly, very weak, given the minute size, batteries and price!
Ergo, I can  offer an educated guess (as I no longer (very temporarily)
have a Brompton to experiment with).
<BR>
My guess is that it should still work under most imaginable circumstances,
as most of the mass of the bag/cargo is in front of the line-of-sight,
where the signal would be most reliable. I believe I recall using both bag
& computer on a few trips and having it work fine, but I may be inventing
again! ;-)
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Channell Wasson, Oct 1997:</EM><BR>
Yes the handlebars are too far away for the wireless speedometers
to bick up a signal from the transmitter on the front fork.  I have
tried several diferent speedos and found this always to be the case.  My
solution has been to mount the speedometer on the main frame just behind
the folding hinge. The unit I like best is the Cat-Eye. I modified the
mounting bracket and made two holes to accept a plastic zip tie to
attach the speedo mounting clip to the frame.  Problem of transmission
thus eliminated.

with folding and is easy to reach.  I have seen them on the top tube
(horizontal) on Bromptons and am told they don't leak in that position.
They really go just about anywhere (the velcro fastener is very strong).
A cheaper solution (at least for the Birdy) is an automotive "hose

Mine is on the handle bar stem closest to me.  Folds without removal.  I left
it on when I converted to recumbent too.  I put the adhesive backed sandpaper
that Two Fish supplies on the stem under the rubber cage mount and it does
reduce movement.  But I placed it so that the stud that clips the stem to the
fork when folded also prevents the bottle cage from sliding down.

I usually keep a water bottle in the neat little bag that came with the
Brompton soft bag. For longer rides in Italy I fitted a bottle carrier
behind the saddle (Selle Turbo saddle and carrier from St Johns Street
Cycles in Bridgewater Somerset UK) They do a single and double carrier in
high quality plastic which fits the rails with allen key fixing. Chris
Boardman uses something similar for time trials for aerodynamic reasons !
Doesnt affect casual folding but sticks out.

<H2><A NAME="140"></A>Horns</H2>
<EM CLASS="from">Clive Page, Dec 1997:</EM><BR>
Does anyone have a suggestion for what the law calls "audible warning of
approach" (around these parts).  Ideally it should be loud enough to
penetrate the cab of a 40 ton truck (or a sports car where the in-car
entertainment system is going "thumpa-thumpa-thump" at full blast) when
they are still over a hundred metres away.
<BR>
For a time I had an old style hooter with a rubber bulb, but it was hard
to mount it so it was easy to use without fouling the folding of the
handlebars and eventually the reed got corroded and lost its voice.
<BR>
More recently I got a battery-operated device called the "Megahorn" which
emits a high-pitched shriek (not unlike the warning noise from a reversing
bus or truck). It's almost deafening when used indoors, but outside it
doesn't even bother some pedestrians as they step off the kerb without
looking just a short way in front of me.  And recently I've found several
cases in which I was in danger from motor traffic where the driver didn't
notice I was there.  So obviously I need something louder.
<BR>
A horn for a motor-cycle might be loud enough, but I'm not sure where one
could be fitted while keeping the bike foldable (and I don't know how much
power they take). I'm not too worried about weight, as I try not to carry
my bike folded more than short distances.

I've seen people use aerosol powered airhorns fitted in bottle cages. They
are from chandlers shops and used for fog warning in small boats. Behind

I use a bell for pedestrians and a very loud Oi for anything else. If
you've got time to press/squeeze something its not a real emergency
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Custfold, Dec 1997:</EM><BR>
A marine fog horn - operated by compressed gas, is similar in volume & note to
that used on large trucks (around lower A or B flat).  I believe a version
with pump up reservoir is available.
<BR>
Alternatively get a Xenon light (Vistalite) with a clear lens and touch fire
switch for that critical 2 flash burst - Guaranteed to make a motorist slow
right down to at least the legal speed limit.
<BR>
Further alternative is to use a sounder unit which produces a distinctive
2-tone sequence - which our legal eagles can let us know whether its use on a
BIKE is in same classification as its use on a car (which is illegal).  A
drivers hearing is improved by this even at low volumes, just as their sight
is improved drastically by introduction of a bright daglo stripe on your
vehicle - especially if you fit a white fairing :-))
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Bob Gelman, Nov 1999:</EM><BR>
Thirty-five years ago, give or take, I used an aerosol boat horn to take a
somewhat aggressive stand in the jolly streets of New York City.  This was a
thing that looked like a shaving cream aerosol can (same size too) with a horn
on top (you replaced the canister when it was empty).  Quite effective for
dogs, trucks, cabbies, etc.  It fit in a bottle cage.  It was probably louder
than the Zounds.

I frequently found that getting off the bike and putting it between you and
the dog was effective (you kind of move the bike around as if you had a cape
and were a Matador).

My most interesting animal confrontation was in the Canadian Rockies, near

I remember when I was a lad, about 30 years ago, we had a craze for
collecting bike bells, horns etc. I expect it was something to do with our

Anyway, I recall a friend of mine, wealthier than I, bought and fitted a
starters' AIR HORN into a bar mounted bottle cage. It was LETHAL, Even
better, it was DIRECTIONAL and just about at car window height. I well
remember him sounding off at left turning road hogs and making them swerve

motorists entitled by divine right to drive over schoolboys in the nearside
lane and would usually stop to tell us off for our reckless behaviour
(trying to save our own lives was considered reckless in the extreme)
Eventually one of our own teachers confiscated it following a complaint
from the old biddy next to the school who would regularly drive out into
the flow of children without pausing to look.
<BR>
Point is it worked. The trouble we got into was because it worked. They
couldn't ignore us so they persecuted us so beware of reprisals if you try
it.

Ah, now here's a suggestion for a LOUD horn.
AirZound 2 is a rechargable air horn.
It has a variable volume and, at its loudest, can be heard within any
vehicle.
I'm not sure how it will be distributed in the U.K. Drop an e-mail to
Andrew at BICYCLENUT@AOL.COM. He should be able to direct you to the right
place. I've been using an AirZound 2 for a few months and LOVE it!
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Jfreewheel, Dec 1997:</EM><BR>
Try the airzound 2.  Its an airhorn system.  You pump compressed air in a
water bottle sized plastic canister using your pump.  Good for about 50
blasts.
Will wake up your soul when you here it.  Volume is adjustable too.
I use one for commuting and you sound bigger than actually is.
<BR>
I think we still have a picture under the Closeouts section of the site.

The air vessel of my AirZound 2 is fixed on top of the main tube, in
front of the saddle when folded, so not in the way.  The horn is
obviously on the handlebars and doesn't project from the folded package,
although the air switch does form a local peak.  This results in the
slight problem of blasting awake other passengers when the air switch
touches its environment in unforeseen ways.
<BR>
They are definitely loud and keeap pressure like tires do.  I'm not too
happy with the air switch, it's not optimized to be blown in an
emergency situation, but I managed to fit it so that I can fire away
while applying the brakes.
More precisely, the plastic gizmo that you fix to the handlebars, where
the AirZound clicks into, broke, together with the volume control.
So I hooked the AirZound directly around the end of the bracing bar
and tied it up with a few loop of metal wire.
The volume is hard to adjust, so it's always at its hardest.
I've only used in a few times; on one occasion the offending motorists
didn't seem to notice.  Its main use is to make the rider feel confident
and to impress the crowd gathered around the folder.

Gotta put my nose in on this one....
<BR>
YES! THE AIR ZOUND WORKS LIKE THIS TEXT READS--LOUD!!
<BR>
The beauty is that by using the control valve one can dial in an almost
pleasant toot. But, if you need to be heard this thing can damage ear drums.
People think it's a truck. I think I've induced two or three heart attacks in
the S.F. Bay Area.

They are very good indeed. We fitted one to a Brompton - just - without
impeding folding, but I think we'll transfer the whole outfit to a front
pannier.

"Freon" Boat horns are louder than AirZounds.  They look like a shaving
cream can with a horn on top.  Fit right in water bottle cage.  I used
one in manhattan in the 50s.  You don't use it very often.  Has the
added advantage that you can take it out of holder and stick it right in
the window of the offending car that has almost killed you.  More
effective than kicking doors or hoods (bonnets).  Still, any of these
activities may, these days of road rage, lead to bicyclecide.  I
personally like to just smile at offenders; totally disarming.

Mounted one a few months ago, and recently made it permeant.  The horn itself
is on my left-hand-side of the handlebar; the "bottle" is mounted on the
frame, on the left side, behind the joint.  I've just let the line run free
from here to there.  It is not a problem with folding; although I do have to
be careful carrying, as its possible to knock into the "bottle" with my leg.
( maybe I should jsut swap out that folding pedal, then everything would be
OK).

I usually carry an ultrasonic "Dazer" which will keep most dogs a good distance away
if you aim it well.  I've seen some dogs jump and turn 180 degrees and others ignore
it.  My other device is a can of serious pepper spray, not the weak stuff they sell
in most bike shops in the US, although the same handle bar mount works.  The spray
is OK at close distances if the wind is in your favor, but be careful.  I prefer the
kind with an Ultra Violet dye which shows up under "black light".  Dogs usually
leave you alone the second time if you get it in their eyes but they are angrier, so
who is to say what is best?  The ultrasonic "Dazer" is better in wind and cold but
rain will wreck it for weeks.  If it is cold, keep the spray in a pocket to warm it
or it loses pressure.
<BR>
Actually the air horn (meant for cars) works somewhat on dogs and usually alerts
their Humans, at least in the country.  I haven't figured out how to mount a "Zound"
brand air horn on Brompton.  They have trouble in the cold too unless you keep the
pressure down.
<BR>
The best results I have had on regular routes is to call the animal control office,
and they give me the phone number of the dogs owners after they issue a citation.
Then if I still have trouble, I call the owners before I ride by the next time.
Actually my female riding buddy called them on the cell phone last time and I
haven't seen the dogs loose since.  Hate to see a pretty girl get bitten I guess.

I recommend the Zefal bar end mirror. Just bought and fitted one. Easy
to fit and folds in on itself when folding the bike. Can be purchased
from (larger?) Halfords in UK.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Stein Somers, Feb 1998:</EM><BR>
Better late than never: I also bought one, mainly - I admit - because it
was so cheap. I soon realised it was cheap because it was a right side
model, less usefull on the continent. Turned out left side wouldn't have
been usefull either because it would scrape the ground on a folded B.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Daniel Meyerowitz, Nov 1998:</EM><BR>
Having tried several, I found the best mirror for the Brompton to be the
Rhode Gear Multi Mirror (made by the ubiquitous Bell Sports). It has two
hinge points, so it can fold completely out of the way when the bike is
collapsed (it tucks between the two bicycle wheels when the Brompton is
folded). It is much more durable than other folding mirrors, and has a
larger, oval-shaped viewing area. It's a natural, flat glass mirror and
doesn't distort the objects reflected in it. The mirror is vibration
resistent, adjustable to almost any viewing angle, and reasonably
lightweight. I've had absolutely no trouble with mine after a year of daily
riding, touring, taking the Brompton on planes and trains, etc.
<BR>
Cycling in the States, where a mirror is placed on the left side of the
handlebars, I made one small adjustment to my mirror. The mirror plugs into
the left end of the handlebar, and is tightened in place with a bar-end
knob. That knob can scrape against the ground when the bike is folded, so
it's best just to remove it altogether and replace it with a 5mm nut. The
bolt that the nut threads onto can be replaced with a shorter one, or the
original can be sawed off to a shorter length. In either case, this is all
accomplished in a few minutes.
<BR>
Once the mirror is attached, the tightening knob is unneccessary, since the
mirror stays on the handlebars all the time. And if for some reason you
need to remove the mirror, you simply unscrew the 5 mm nut.
<BR>
I think a mirror (360 vision, anticipating approaching vehicles, seeing a
dog bounding towards you) is as essential to safe riding as a helmet. In my
experience, the Multi Mirror is an elegant, inexpensive, and practical
solution for the Brompton.
