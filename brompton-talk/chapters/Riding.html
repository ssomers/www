<EM CLASS="from">Stein Somers, May 1998:</EM><BR>
With a fresh pair of primo's (mail-ordered from and then taken back to
England...) I cycled around until I found paradise: a low traffic,
wind shielded stretch of smooth tarmac descending steeply and then
rising gently, with well spaced road markings starting at the perfect
place.  One problem was I didn't have a pressure gauge...  Anyway I
let myself roll down and up again without peddling and counted the
road markings, for different bike configurations.  The results are
in the table below the load of text I will now produce.
<BR>
While establishing the accuracy of the test, as well as a measure for
the 90psi still left in my rear Raleigh Record, a puncture crossed
my way... down to the 70psi my compact pump can deliver, at least
given enough human power.
<BR>
First test: the best coasting gear of my five speed.  Corresponding
to the sound (and feel, I used to wonder?), I found 2nd gear is best,
4th worst and the others lie somewhere in between.  Sometimes 3th gear
is as silent and as smooth as 2nd, sometimes it seems something inside
sticks and 3rd makes more noise and the bike doesn't roll as far.
All the same, I conclude that the circle around the 2 on the five
speed gear controller means not only "adjust the rod in this gear"
but also "0th gear" for peddleless cruising.
<BR>
Second test: I exchanged the rear Raleigh for a Primo, and...
my goodness, it clearly slowed me down!  In retrospect the difference
wasn't that great and I'm sure my arms didn't quite push up the psi
in the Primo as they did in the punctured Raleigh.
<BR>
I then set my hopes on the front tyre.  This was still a Raleigh
set a low pressure because lately I had been riding through the
cobblestone infested centre of Ghent.  What a relief when this
proved to be the place where a Primo scored!  Particularly if
you inflate them at a moderate pressure.
<BR>
Just in time the idea occurred to relate these results to other topics
of riding efficiency.  Here we go. The Gain/Loss numbers reflect the
extra distance I could roll compared to the reference.  This is
definitely not a linear measure!
<BR>
Reference = Standard T5 = Raleigh Records at (very roughly!) 60psi,
coasting in 2nd gear, upright riding on the standard best folding
handlebar position, pannier clipped in the front luggage block,
95kg total load, tall 1m96 rider.  Anything else?  I carried the same
amount and shape of load on all tests and repeated every roll
several times (I even postponed organic waist dumping for the sake of
science!  I did sweat under the midday sun though...).

Here in Castle Cary, we've been using the same test hill for some time.
We've found that if you put the same rider on the same bike, and sit him
in the same position under the same weather conditions, the results are
pretty accurate.
<BR>
Measuring average speed in MPH from a standing start, we found that
Swallow tyres performed best at 70psi, hitting 13mph, a well-worn set of
Raleigh Records performed best at 60psi, achieving 13.6mph, and the
Primos gave the best results, managing almost 14mph at just 50psi.
We went on to fine tune the pressures and found a performance peak at
about 14.3mph with 65psi in the rear tyre and 45psi in the front.
1.3mph best to worst might not sound much, but it's a 10% performance
boost for very little outlay.
<BR>
Obviously, the weight of the rider has an effect, but we went on to
produce a recommended pressure v rider weight chart, which was printed in
Folder 18. There's no doubt that Primos give a clear advantage, but you
need to set the pressures with care.

<H3><A NAME="57"></A>Suspension versus efficieny (biopacing?)</H3>
<UL>
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Stein Somers, May 2000:</EM><BR>
A Brompton user recently aired concerns about the suspension block
consuming part of his muscular output. Something referred to as
biopacing, although an internet search suggests this term was really
invented for oval chainrings.  Anyway, everyone can see the suspension
block squeezed in and out at each pedal stroke; when you try to do the
same off the bike, the effort seems huge.
<BR>
So, I wondered while stumping up a steep hill the other day, how much is
that squeaky little devil costing me?  When riding at speed with a
standard 6W generator on, it doesn't take long for the generator to
start feeling warm.  The 6W is the power sent over to the bulbs; more
than twice that power is taken from the wheel.  Roughly some 10W is
wasted heating up the generator.
<BR>
The suspension block doesn't seem to become warm at all.  Of course
rubber doesn't pronounces its temperature as good as metal, but if I've
been wasting a sizable amount of energy, shouldn't I feel *something*?
<BR>
I gather from literature that during this effort, leaving me out of
breath, I might be hammering 400 watts through that poor chain.  And it
seems the suspension block accounts for at most a mere percent of that?
So why bother...
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Matt Hayworth, May 2000:</EM><BR>
Yea, it seems like the point of shock absorption and springy seats is partly
to cut down on rider fatigue which results in part from being jarred
unnecessarily.  So the shock absorber probably does more good than harm.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">David Dodson, May 2000:</EM><BR>
Pure springs do not absorb any energy (but absorb shocks...).
<BR>
So-called 'shock absorbers' (in the conventional use of this term)
are energy absorbers used to attenuate oscillations in springy
position-control systems such as transport suspension systems.
Energy-wise they convert motive power (only) to heat. A springy
suspension element may be included in the shock aborber unit
(as in some car shock absorbers with an outer coil spring element).
<BR>
Rubber shock absorbers are (usually) in effect mainly springs,
but not pure springs -- the rubber's hysteresis absorbs energy.
But if they don't heat up much they are not absorbing much energy.
<BR>
But if you have anything at all like a car shock absorber -
typically an oil filled cylinder with a piston with holes in
it that the oil is forced through - then we are probably in
the realms of much greater energy absorbtion than with rubber.

<H2><A NAME="59"></A>What are gear inches?</H2>
<EM CLASS="from">Peter Amey, Jul 1998:</EM><BR>
<DFN>Gear inches</DFN> are the diameter in inches of wheel that would roll as far in one
revolution as the bike would travel for one turn of the pedals in a gear
of the same number of inches.  Imagine an "ordinary" (or penny-farthing)
bike; a 90" gear is the same as riding one with a 90" front wheel.
<BR>
Metric gears are usually in terms of the actual distance travelled for
one turn of the pedals.  i.e.
<BR>
pi * GearInInches * ConversionFromInchesToMeters
<BR><EM CLASS="from">Ruud van Tol, Jul 1998:</EM><BR>
In other words: it's the (imaginary) size of the wheel when there wouldn't
be any gear.

<H2><A NAME="ticking"></A>Is it normal for the hub gears to go "tick-tick-tick" when you pedal forward?</H2>
<UL>
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Stein Somers, Sep 1997:</EM><BR>
Absolutely, though only in middle (neutral) gear and above.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Anthony Cartmell, Sep 1997:</EM><BR>
The ticking is coming from a free-wheel ratchet in the hub gear.  The
hub has a couple of epicyclic gear sets, with dog clutches and ratchets
to change gears.  If you change gear while free-wheeling you can hear
the different ratchets buzzing at different speeds.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Phil Gough, Sep 1997:</EM><BR>
My older model 5-speed ticks at twice the rate as it has two sets of pawls.

<H2><A NAME="60"></A>My heels hit those darn castors!</H2>
<EM CLASS="from">Custfold:</EM><BR>
[The rear castors, at the front of the rear rack, are]
odd shaped rollers that used to catch my heels (usually its women who
have the problem as they cycle with feet closer in).
<UL>
<LI><EM CLASS="from">David Hansen, Sep 1997:</EM><BR>
This was a problem for this male, until I unscrewed the Brompton
wheels, turned them round and screwed them back in. As a result it is
hard to catch my shoes, as they slide down the slope of the coned
part of the wheel.
<BR>
This does make the folded bike slightly less stable, but not to any
noticeable extent.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">mike, Oct 1998:</EM><BR>
I have big feet and did a lot
of damage to my ankles by knocking them on the castors at the front end of
the rack in the first couple of weeks -
I now have an unstable bromton when folded because I removed the front
(large castors) and I have not made my ankles bleed since.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Mr A Follis, Oct 1998:</EM><BR>
My problem with the castor wheels is that they snag the
turn-ups on my good trousers.  I've ripped one pair.  Then again maybe
turn-ups are out of fashion and Brompton are just doing me a favour.

<H2><A NAME="waggle"></A>Waggly rear ends</H2>
<EM CLASS="from">Roland Elsenberg, Aug 1998:</EM><BR>
[...] I found it less precise in steering.
This is probably due to a worn hinge between the main
frame and the rear triangle.
<UL>
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Rob Cope, Aug 1998:</EM><BR>
Roland & anyone else with waggly rear ends (Brompton, that is),
<BR>
You need to get your dealer/agent to have a look ASAP.  The main bearing
between frame & rear triangle is worn or loose: unlikely to break
(substantial piece of silver steel) but it does you & the bike no good to
keep using it.  Whatever you do, do *not* just tighten up end screws with an
allen key: they are Loctited in place & screwing/ unscrewing breaks the seal
& makes it likely to loosen up more.
<BR>
When this happened to me last year, I ended up back at the factory (live 2
km away lucky me) for a new bearing sleeve: presume your dealer can sort it
out locally.
<BR>
All done under guarantee: Brompton stand by their products.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">David Henshaw - A to B Magazine, Aug 98:</EM><BR>
Several very important points here.
<BR>
ONE Never, ever unscrew the allen-head screws holding the rear triangle
to the frame... honestly, there is nothing in there worth looking at. The
screws are Locktighted in place at a high preset torque. If you break the
Locktight, the screws WILL certainly unfasten in use and the rear
triangle could come adrift.
<BR>
TWO Because the bearings need to be very accurately reamed to size with a
custom-made reaming tool, only Brompton can fit them. So the assembly is
neither user or dealer serviceable at present.
<BR>
THREE As enthusiastic Brompton users you can do two things: Keep an eye
on the screws - any movement may mean one has come loose. If the bike is
more than a year or so old, run oil into the bearings on a regular basis.
If you commute every day in all weathers, that should really be once a
week.
<BR>
FOUR Movement in the bearing is not a problem. My six year old bike has
quite a bit of play and I barely notice it on the road. Once the rubber
suspension is compressed, the triangle is restrained from moving sideways
too much.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Phil Gough, Mar 1999:</EM><BR>
Owners in the London area of ageing and/or high mileage Bromptons which have developed slack rear fork pivots
may be interested that Tim Whiity of Cyclecare (30 Blythe Road, London W14 0HA)
has got the tool to do this job.
He has just rejuvenated my 1988 T5 which no longer shimmies about when carrying a load on the back.
Cost was just under &pound;40, but I had partially dismantled the bike before I took it in (to fix another problem).
You get new bushes, pivot, nylon washers and Allen-head machine screws.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Custfold, Mar 1999:</EM><BR>
I have - through breaking about 6 rear frames - had the rear pivot spindle out
on many occasions.
<BR>
A few comments -
<OL>
<LI>the spindle does wear noticably, and on one quadrant more than the other 3
I fit new spindles if I notice wear.
<LI>the ptfe washers collapse - I now use brass ones
<LI>the system for the machine screws is not brilliant - I have tried star
washers under the coutersink faces, and am trying to locate screws with better
quality drive sockets which can be impact driven to tighten them and do away
with the unreliable locktite system.  A tip is that if your chainring is
larger you cut a nick to allow the bolt to be tightened without having to take
the transmission apart.
</OL>
<LI><EM CLASS="from">David Edge, Apr 1999:</EM><BR>
AFAIK the advice against DIY is the need to precision ream the new bushes
once you've put them in.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Custfold, Mar 2000:</EM><BR>
It may be worth checking first that the PTFE washers that take side thrust
are not kaput.
<BR>
I've replaced mine with brass washers and also looked at impact drive CSK
machine screws as both these are sources of slop in rear end usually well
before the pivot bush fails - but they do wear, as pins removed but destroyed
when changing rear frames have shown.

<H2><A NAME="61"></A>Adjusting suspension</H2>
If the suspension is too weak for your weight...
<UL>
<LI>
Try the fully adjustable version suggested by the designer - aka a
standard Brompton block with a jubilee clip (approx 50p) restraining
its, err, fuller figure from bulging too much.
[ A jubilee clip or hose clamp (US) is ] a circular band tightened by
a screw, often used to hold hosepipes on to water taps.  Ironmongers
have them.  Result: fully adjustable suspension!

<H2><A NAME="62"></A>Rear mudguard too short (the mud striped back syndrom)</H2>
<UL>
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Bernd Bieker:</EM><BR>
I had the same problem and attached a small 4" flexible plasic strip to
the rear fender.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Jane Thomas:</EM><BR>
Definitely too short! Although when I phoned Brompton they denied there
was a problem. I ended up with a super-duper extension made out of a
front muguard and castor so the whole thing still rolls under when
folding (I found my early experiments caught the ground when flicking
the wheel under to fold). The extra length also allowed me to mount a
Busch & Muller 4D lite on the mudguard (dynamo driven LED light +
capacitor so it stays on when you stop), and I am very happy with the
arrangement.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Malcolm Lyon:</EM><BR>
My only disappointment with the bike has been the silly short mudguard, or
fender, fitted to the L model.  When riding in the rain, I found I finished
up with a skunk stripe up my back.  I am pleased to say I have solved the
problem by developing a semi rigid mud flap which in no way restricts the
folding.  Brompton Bicycles did dot think it could work but I have
demonstrated it to them at their factory and can assure you it does.
<BR>
It is easy to make.  Just cut a piece of semi stiff butyl rubber sheet of
one eighth inch thickness into a rectangle of 4 inches by 1 and 7/8ths. It
can be held in place by 2 pop rivets with rivet washers to sandwich it. Or
if you want a really simple fitting drill two 3mm holes about 15mm apart,
down the centre line on the mudguards tail and secure the flap with 3mm
cable tie.
<BR>
I have made up a small stock of these and I am pleased to say that I have
recieved a good number of orders from Folding Society members here in UK.  I
mention the construction details in case any of our Brompton pals in more
isolated areas, like the US, want to overcome the problem.  I call the
device a Damp Patch Eliminator,... DPE ... or Skunky for short!
<BR>
For the kits that I produce, I use butyl rubber of about 3.5mm thickness.
When this is riveted in place under the mudguard it takes up only about 4mm
which is a very small intrusion into the clearance.. the cable tie method is
slightly thinner.  On the L model to increase the clearance you merely
gently squeeze the four mudguard stays together towards the centre plane of
the wheel and the clearance is increased.  This is needed anyway from time
to time with thumping the roller wheel takes when tucking the rear wheel.
<BR>
The natural curvature induced by the mudguard to the flap, adds to it
rigidity giving it a springyness to resist deformation by the tuck under.
It works beautifully.  I took it to show the Brompton factory - they were
surprised but impressed.. and said they had been considering a solution.
<BR>
On the T model there should be enough clearance but I guess one can gain bit
more through adjustment.
<BR>
You do not need a wide or pear shaped flap the rear as the spray comes
straight off the centre of the tyre.  On the front a wide flap is needed
because your also have to cope with the spray deflected from the road
towards the botton bracket and your feet.  I doubt if a curved in front flap
will over come this problem.
<P>
I am marketing a simple kit which will completely eliminate the problem of
your rear damp patch.  This has been developed and tested on the L model but
I hear from people that it works well on the T model too.

This is not commercial venture - just a service to fellow Brompton enthusiasts!
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Peter Amey:</EM><BR>
A rear mudflap works wonders.  On my T5 I found I could not use any of the
commercial mudflaps I found because they all need to go between the
mudguard and the tyre; on my bike at least, there simply isn't room.  I
cut a mudflap out of an old inner tube and used impact adhesive (Evostick)
to fasten it to the outside of the (thoroughly cleaned with alcahol)
mudguard.  The flap is 3 inches long and extends 2 inches below the end of
the mudguard.  It is pear shaped being the width of the mudguard at the
top and about 3 inches across near the bottom.  To make it keep its shape
I laminated it with a couple more pieces of inner tube using rubber
solution.  I no longer have a mud stripe up my back so it must work.
Being rubber, the midflap doesn't seem to suffer from flicking the ground
when I break the bike's back (before wringing its neck to complete the
fold :-)) - stiffer materials, such as are being discussed for front
mudguard extensions, might well get ripped off during the folding process.

At the moment a thin plastic patch the width of the mudguard (cut from

4cm measured at the centre.  It is fixed between a stronger plastic

with 2 tiny nuts and bolts through the sides of the mudguard, and has
been guarding mud without intervention for a pleasant time.

It may be that the clamp plate has stretched - I'm checking with Brompton

The chainwheel disk (chainguard) is attached at 5 points to holes in the chainwheel.
When starting at a traffic light I accidently kicked 2 of these 5 fixing points out of their holes in the chainwheel.
Trying to get them into their holes again prooved difficult. After some banging and cursing I examined the chainguard closer.
Turns out that the chainguard has little plugs fitted where it is inserted into the chainwheel.
You push the plugs back to the outside, insert the chainguards plastic hooks into the holes in the chainwheel,
and push the plugs flush with the rest of the chainguard. Job done.
When you try to push the chainguard back on without moving the plugs first you are more than likely to damage the chainguard hooks,
and the thing will come off again.  No earth- shattering revelation, but I thought I'd let you know.

Don't be too sure that the noise is coming from the bottom bracket. I had a
similar situation a year ago, and went slightly nuts trying to figure out
the source of the noise. I, too, was pretty sure it was from the area of
the bottom bracket, and figured it was probably one of the pedals. After a
lot of experimentation, I finally established that the source was actually
the front wheel. The bearings had apparently not been adequately lubricated
in the first place, and were now noisy, but with a sound that I would not
have expected.

<EM CLASS="from">Nico van Beek, Aug 2000:</EM><BR>
I bought, some one and a half year ago a T3. Great fun. Everybody wanted
folding demo's.
However, after some time a vague clanking started in the neighbourhood
of the back-wheel.
Couldn't find exactly where. I performed greasing and tightening of
screws and nuts. Didn't solve the problem.
So: back to the dealer, who checked the bike.
"Did you solve my problem"? No, that appeared to be not really possible.
Had to do with something within the nave of the back-wheel. A common
Brompton problem. Dismantling the nave would not give any solution.
Not very satisfactory! The rattling became worse (and in Holland we do
not have tarmac everywhere as in California).
So I wrote to the factory. Answer came from the main distributor in
Holland by telephone. A nice chat about grease, oil, tirepressure etc.
However it may be: a well known problem! Had to do with the general
construction: only one hinge between back and front parts and therefor
no possibility to spread the rumour over the total frame.
Again, not satisfactory. I'm now in the stage to advise others not to
buy Brompton, unless they can cope with a lot of, now very noisy
rattling. I took the nave completely apart, greased, oiled, well did
everything, but the problem still exists.
<BR>
Freewheeling on, let's say, rough surfaces,
is the main problem. Has nothing to do with little wheels but with the
inside of the SA nave.

I had this on my T5 for a while. Everytime I hit a bump
there was an almighty 'clang' sound. I originally thought that
it was the rear jockey wheels...however, I found out that the
back wheel was very slighly loose. i.e. the compression nut
on the rear bearings was not done up enough. I found this
out by turning the bike upside down and gripping the wheel,
and being able to rock it side to side very slightly. I
took the wheel off and did up the compression nut just
enough to stop the play - but no more than that as the
bearings will wear out prematurely if too tight.

<LI><EM CLASS="from">Roland Elsenberg, Aug 2000:</EM><BR>
some weeks ago I took my Sprinter 5 apart. I found that a tiny spring from a

or if it depends on the gear I drive. I confess I forget to sort that out
every time I enjoy a ride.
On my Gazelle with SA 3-speed a noise appeared at 10000 km. In an
advertisement by Sachs I found a sentence like: "some hubs are reported to
have lasted for 10000 km". Surely 10000 km is nothing Sturmey-Archer would
advertise about. The Gazelle is now well above 30000 with the hub still
going. It even gets quieter, or perhaps my ears worse :)

Yes, the noise is a problem on my bike as well. About a year ago there
was a thread in this list about it. I went as far as removing everything
on the rear triangle and came to conclude that it originates at the hub.
I promised myself to take the hub apart but haven't come round to it
yet. One of the list members described how he had ruled out the coasters
by riding with his feet on the rear carrier touching the coasters. Don't
try this at home was his sound advice.

I compared the noise to empty cans on a string being pulled behing the
bike. Very entertaining on cobblestones. I wouldn`t go as far as
advising people against buying a Brompton, but it is definately much
less enjoiable on poor surfaces. Now that the brake issue is solved we
might get to the bottom of this. Has anybody experiene with other hubs
on the Brompton? I know the rear triangle is too narrow to take other
hubs unmodifieed, but have heard of several attempts to use the Sachs 3
and 5 Speed and even the Rohloff. Do they clank as well? And what makes
that clanking noise in the Sturmey-Archer? Any ideas?

Boy, I'm happy my T5's are quiet.  I'm very sensitive to noise,

The Sachs 7 speed on my recumbent however rattles annoyingly, although I

changing problems.  The Sachs 5 on my cumbersome are quiet until they
implode (which took four months for the first two).

I read on the Utopia Forum that the Rohloff 14 speed makes a distinct
grinding noise in the lowest gears.  The Shimano hubs are reported to
exhibit not even ticking, but I know someone who complained that the
roller brake rattled like hell.  I rode one recently and it was very
quiet and braking power smoothly controllable. Alas, maximum braking

A friend's T5 and mine both did this when they were new.  It sounds just

several times.  This eventually fixed my one (I also took the rubber

As well as the pivot, heavier riders can break up the system used to fix the
suspension rubber.  This will cause the bolt to 'saw' a neat slot down from
its original position through the plate on the rear frame, and at the same
time slim down the bolt by wearing away the thread, and then the rest of it.
This will give a squeaking noise.

I have made a system which rigidly fixes the rubber to the frame,
and has a 'floating' metal bearer pad which rests on the main frame
(and does not crack up with heavy loads).

I had creaking noise on my Brompton which took some time to trace [...]
to the rear suspension block (Shock absorber)
The  bolt was rubbing with the metal of the rear frame. The metal to
metal contact had cut a slot in the rear frame. The reason for the
failure appeared to be a stepped bush that the shock absorber bolt
passes through.
<BR>
The rear frame is about UKP100 and the washer is probable a few pence
but has to be bought as part of the rear shock absober UKP 8.
<BR>
When I got the part as with brompton parts there was some fitting
instructions that told you how to pre compress the shock absorber and
thus prevent the bush jumping out of position.

It would appear that I am not the only one to have had this failure. It
would be helpful if this adjustment were in the owners manual.

The creaking is probably caused by a loose crank arm.
If the sound remains after tightening the bolt, then it could be the bottom bracket.
Chains do stretch after a while especially after the kind of riding you described.
<BR>
A loose bottom bracket might also cause creaking.
It's a good idea to overhaul the bottom bracket about once a year,
especially if you ride during the winter in the rain.
<BR>
A stretched chain also wears down the teeth on your rear cog and more so the chain ring,
since it's aluminium.
You can tell if you've got a stretched chain if you can see space between the link and teeth
when you pull the chain tight.
Also the teeth on the chain ring will be sharp and pointed.
If your chain is really stretched, it will skip, especially when pedaling hard.
In any case, if you see any of these symptons, you need to replace the chain ring
along with the chain.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Deborah Eacock, Oct 1999:</EM><BR>
I suggest that you check your cranks.  Disconnect the chain from the front

I've had a squeak in my seat post, where it attached to my seat, on my Birdy.

I actually thought it came from the FRONT of the bike for quite a while. I
finally asked someone jogging if they would allow me to ride along side them
so they could "listen" and tell me what part of the bike it was coming from.
This was really deceptive since there was no torsional movement when you
weren't pedaling and the squeak stopped when you coasted.  I suspected
something in the bottom bracket, chain area for a long time.  Spokes rubbing
together can be especially tricky.  One just has to be patient with these
things and track them down.

<EM CLASS="from">Custfold:</EM><BR>
The other day I noted that the paint at the n/s (left) joint between the
chainstay and pivot hinge plate had lifted.  My concern was justified, when
the 'crack' noises which had been up to then untraceable revealed their
source when the chainstay split neatly around the circumference at the high
stress point where the thin walled tube is brazed to the thicker pivot plate -
modern Bromptons do try to spread this load by having a slightly different
design to the first machines produced, which had the benefit and weight of
the substantial integrated carrier and reaer frame.  With the tie between the
rear triangle and the main frame, the bike remained rideable with care to
limp back to base, albeit with the key clue to any incident like this, the
unnerving crab wise travel of the main frame when compared to the road, as
one looks down - fi your bike starts doing this look carefully at the frame
for any damage..
<BR>
Note that with the rear frame securely lashed to the main frame seat tube, I
have 'ridden' a bike with both chain stays fractured after a particularly
severe bout of damage.  The n/s stay rarely goes in normal use, as the o/s is
the one subjected to cyclic compression & tension loads, but the attachment
of a trailer will obviously affect this - especially if the load is all going
through the n/s of the triangle to the rest of the frame.

I had the same annoying

with the right pedal from an old Bickerton, which is better quality anyway.

Easy solution to this one.
Drill a small hole in the plastic end-cap and inject oil

I have tried tightening all the screws and so on at the rear but this has

Taken hold of the upper section of the rear triangle and firmly holding
this with bike on its wheels, tried to rotate this around the rear pivot in
the same plane as its axis of rotation.  My rear pivots regularly loosen and
there ar 2 key clues - a small discomforting change in handling which becomes
more pronounced as the condition worsens, and a wobble when folding the back
under.  My opinion of important connections secured by Loctite (tm) if a
proper mechanical system is a viable option is that a design improvement is
desirable.  The Brompton design however has a lot of constraints which
mitigate against the over engineered belt & braces, and I have cut a slot in
the (53/61) chainrings, to allow me to get a Allen keys into the sockets
without dismantling the crankset every time (tip here, do this so that the
other side is not covered by the l/h crank!).  I have however recently
painted the bolts, with Hammerite (tm) paint and tightened them into the
paint film.  I think there might be other action to develop this further but
it hasn't been a pressing issue, as I can always tighten the things as
needed.  The trailer howver does knock 6 bells out of the rear end,
especially when you've got around 100Kg on the tail!
<LI>
Have you checked the suspension system.  The original one has a bolt and
guide which float in the rear frame, and will obviously be tight when you're
not sitting on the bike.  As a very heavy (120+Kg with backpack) rider I soon
cut the plastic face from the unit, and then proceeded to have the fixing
bolt saw its way down through the frame, and rub itself into a waisted, and
wasted shadow of its former self.  Fortuitously the hole is suitable for an
M8 bold which can be fixed to the rear frame, if  the suspension rubber has
some degree of float (as on the Birdy IIRC), and I may try some Birdy rubbers
as an option one of these days.

[...] my T5 has exactly the symptoms that you
describe and has had them for the last year or so.  Like you, I have tried
and failed to find the cause.  If the rattle does suggest the hub is on the
way out, mine seems to be taking quite a while to die and otherwise works
just fine.  (There's a foolishly over-confident statement!)
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Graham S Jones, Nov 1998:</EM><BR>
Maybe it's heresay to mention another make, but hub-geared Moultons have being making rear end rattles since 1962.  From the bottom bracket back, Bromptons, Moultons and AMs are very much the same.  The rattles have something to do with the amplitude of vibration of small wheels on the road and idle hub gear internals - hence why it stops when you pedal.
<BR>
My L5 rattles, but my 1963 Moulton Deluxe (FW S-A hub) has done so since I got it 10 years ago,
and it's still going strong.

This sounds to me like a misaligned chain tensioner - the chain is perhaps
running with the sideplates on the jockeys. If you can get someone to hold
the back of the bike up while you turn the pedals it will be obvious enough.

<H3><A NAME="74"></A>Noise from the front</H3>
<EM CLASS="from">Willi Mindak, Jun 99:</EM><BR>
For a couple of weeks now my T5 has developed an irritating noise that repeats itself with every turn of the front wheel.
I suspected the wheel bearings or the cones, but when I examined them they looked o.k. to me.
The bearings showed no wear at all (at least I could see none), and the cones had just a small, uniform line of wear were the bearings are running.
This 'line of wear' is visible, but you don't feel anything when you run you finger over it.
Regreasing the front hub brought no improvement, neither did turning the wheel back to front.
The noise only appears when the bike is ridden. When the front wheel is spun without load all is quiet.
Can the noise be caused by uneven spoke tension? Any ideas?

<H2><A NAME="75"></A>Why is the Brompton's steering sensitive?</H2>
<EM CLASS="from">Riddell, Toby, Jun 2000:</EM><BR>
Is this anything to do with the frame geometry, in particular the trail?
<BR>
I have noticed that when pushing my Brompton along, holding it just by the
saddle and steering it by leaning it one way or the other, it is less
responsive than other bikes, that is say the amount of turn is small for a
given amount of lean. I think this reflects a shorter trail. And this in
turn is reflected in the fact that it's harder to balance the bike when
riding it hands free, there is less self-centering.
<BR>
Does this make sense?
<BR>
When researching folding bicycles I came across a report concerning a
particular model of Dahon. It had a geometry which meant that there was no
self-centering effect. A case came to court because someone was riding one
when he looked over his shoulder and took one hand off the handlebar -
because of the lack of self-centering he could not tell with one hand which
way the front wheel was pointing and it turned to 90 deg. and he was
deposited on the deck. So presumably this Dahon had no trail at all?
<UL>
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Jim McLaughlin, Jun 2000:</EM><BR>
I'm not sure what you mean by "trail", I am guessing that is what we call
"caster" in the US.  Caster does affect the self steering.  I believe it is
defined something like this:
<BR>
Project a line down the axis of the fork to the point where it hits the
ground.  The tire will hit the ground usually somewhat behind this, and the
offset is referred to as caster.
<BR>
I'm not versed in the trade offs, though I believe the racing types prefer
twitchy steering (less caster?) and the masses perhaps prefer less twitchy
steering.  I assume the small wheels have much to do with it.  For example,
every recumbent I have seen has a small wheel in front and it is a given that
recumbents do not lend themselves to riding with no hands.
<BR>
The Brompton's short wheel base might have something to do with it but I think
less so.
<BR>
We need a physicist or engineer out there who can enlighten us on the
geometry.  But rest assured that one quickly becomes accustomed to the
Brompton's balance, there is no special danger.
Riding with no hands is never a good idea on any bike.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Ka Lun Tam, Jun 2000:</EM><BR>
I have experienced that too, pushing my bike by the saddle.
I had always assumed that part of the reason I can steer from the saddle on a
regular bike was because the weight of the front wheel allowed it to
"fall" to one side, so I can lean the bike to the left and the wheel would
"Fall" left, thus turning itself to the left.  With the smaller wheel
on the B, I had thought it just wasn't heavy enough.
<BR>
By no means a theory with any scientific basis...
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Wei-Yuen Tan, May 2002:</EM><BR>
Self-steer and steering sensitivity are separate qualities, but both are
related to head-tube angle.  Steering sensitivity decreases as the head-tube
angle departs from vertical.  Self-steer (identical to the caster effect)
increases as trail increases, where trail is the distance between a) the
point of contact between the tire and the ground, and b) the intersection of
the ground with an imaginary line passing through the centre of rotation of
fork (i.e. a line extending from the steering column).  The amount of trail
is determined by the amount of fork-rake and the head-tube angle.
<BR>
To say that the Brompton's steering is due to its small wheels is indirectly
true but inaccurate.  Small wheels, a low headset placement and a telescopic
steering column allow for a compact folded-form but entail that the
head-tube angle must be close to vertical, hence the sensitive steering.

Well, here in Ontario, you're allowed to ride on the sidewalk
so long as your wheels are under 24" in diameter, which the Brompton happens
to have.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Peter O'Reilly, Feb 2000:</EM><BR>
NYC ordinance permits you to ride on the sidewalk only if under age 14 *and*
the bicycle has wheels less than 26 inches in diameter.

<UL>
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Custfold, Aug 2000:</EM><BR>
Wobbles occur mainly as steering geometry alters to reduce the trail - with
small wheels this is more rapildy changed that with large wheels.  Perhaps as
you go faster you put weight forward, and thus create what bikers over here
know as a tank slapper.
<BR>
Sitting back and transferring weight rearwards will increase the trail and a
wobble can be enhance or removed - especially if you have a fairly weighty
backpack on to make weight transfer of considerable effect.
