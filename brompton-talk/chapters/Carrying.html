<H2><A NAME="82"></A>Techniques for carrying a folded Brompton</H2>
<UL>
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Phil Gough:</EM><BR>
I discovered early in my career as a Brompton-riding
and -carrying rail commuter that having about 24lb weight acting as a
straight down pull on the upper arm socket was no joy,
and if one in fact just picked it up in the unfolded state and
tucked the shoulder under the nose of the saddle
then you got a balanced load with the weight
distributed over more muscles and joints.
You can even run with it like this to catch a train.
I rarely carry luggage on the rear carrier, but I found that
it was easier to remove it first as it upset the balance of the load.
At most rail stations the surfaces are usually smooth enough
for towing the bike in folded state using the little wheels,
carrying the luggage in the other hand.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Carl Etnier, Jun 1999:</EM><BR>
This may be old hat to many of you, but it was a serendipitous discovery
for me today.
<BR>
I have carried the folded Brompton either by the nose of the saddle, or by
the middle of the main bar, about at the top of the curve. This is
reasonably close to the fore-aft center of gravity, but considerably to
port of the port-starboard c.o.g. That means that the bottom of the bike
swings in towards my leg, and I have to hold my arm further away from my
body to compensate.
<BR>
Today I discovered by accident that if you hold near the top of the little
curved tube that goes from the bottom bracket to the main tube and angle
the main tube downwards, it is possible with relatively little force to
pivot the bike around the fulcrum of the nose of the saddle on one's wrist,
and hold it so the wheels are perpendicular to the ground. This means that
the bike can be held much closer to one's body without hitting it, and
makes possible a more natural gait.
<UL>
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Gary Kendall, Jun 1999:</EM><BR>
I tend to do similar but without rotating the bike,
hence a little more strain on the wrists. If all you want to do is get the
lateral centre of gravity correct then try turning the saddle slightly to the
right, before lifting the bike by its nose.
</UL>
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Greg Lassonde, Jun 1999:</EM><BR>
I've discovered another way to carry the Brompton that's especially useful
for getting up and down stairs.  I've developed repetitive motion illness
(tennis elbow) from computers and needed an alternative to carrying the full
weight.  So ... I simply hoist the saddle on my  right shoulder and bear
most of the weight there.  I find that I need to keep the bike a short
distance from the side of my leg or the frame clamp will bruise my leg.
<UL>
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Phil Gough, Jun 1999:</EM><BR>
Yes, this is the method I prefer, but with the bike unfolded,
the nose of the saddle in about at the c.g. point
and with the rear half of the bike hanging down behind gives a strain free lift.
I even run for trains with it this way.
</UL>
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Stein Somers, Jun 1999:</EM><BR>
My right hand holds the top tube underneath the saddle. The saddle acts
as a spacer between leg and wrist.  I leave the left crank in a 6
o'clock position, pedal just behind my right leg, rather than turning it
clockwise as prescribed.
</UL>

<H2><A NAME="retain_rear"></A>Stop your rear end from sagging</H2>
When you lift an unfolded Brompton, the rear triangle hangs down.
This is good when you're parking or folding the bike and you swing
the triangle completely under the frame.
But if you just want to carry the bike, for example up stairs,
unless you're quite tall, the triangle will scrape the ground
and make carrying a nuissance.
<UL>
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Custfold, Jul 1997:</EM><BR>
Alternative for non folded transfers is to use a strap (like our system
[which fits around the seat post, clips into the rear
triangle in 5 secs or less, and flicks out to fold equally fast;
contact Custfold for details],
or a toeclip one), which keeps back wheel up,
and then rest nose of saddle on your shoulder.
The balance of the bike, with a lightly loaded, or no front
pannier, is such that it sits with no strain for hands free activity,
in almost any situation - climbing stairs etc.
<BR>
The balance of the bike generally, and its neutral handling allow you to
dismount, let the bike roll on untouched, and place your right hand onto the
frame at the fork of the 'Y', and pick it up cleanly - if you have a wide
grip over the top, if not under the frame.
<BR>
This can also be done when transferring the hand from the saddle, pushing the
bike, down to the frame, and lifting in one clean action - hell this really
needs a video for rider training!
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Stein Somers:</EM><BR>
Seen in Weymouth: a simple plastic bar, pierced through by the seat clamp
on one side, and with a hook on the other side that catches the
luggage rack on the rear triangle.
To let the triangle swing freely again, just lift the lever. It is
kept up by friction.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Channell Wasson, Mar 1998:</EM><BR>
We use the Ortlieb Ex-Tremer dray bag back pack.  All Bromptons
fit into it. $99 US dollars plus shipping of about $20.  I take my bike
aboard airliners with this bag.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Custfold, Mar 1998:</EM><BR>
A standard Brompton should fit an average newspaper delivery bag which comes
complete with shoulder straps - or there is an Ortlieb bag which can be
supplied that a bike will fit in with saddle removed.
<BR>
The cheap option is to use the news bag, which can double as a waterproof
cover for the front pannier - when riding the bike.  Think we'll try and stock
some if there's interest.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Phil Gough, Mar 1998:</EM><BR>
[...] the "rear end hanging down" feature [...] has been useful for me.
A 25-lb bike in folded form acts straight down from the
shoulder and as he says, is not comfortable to carry any
distance, the pain is  exacerbated by having to have the
arms held away to some extent from the body due to width of
the package.  If you hoist the bike up (unfolded) and tuck
your shoulder under the nose of the saddle the weight is
balanced nearer to the centre of the machine and you can
sprint up and down the steps to the rail platform with
relative ease.  The hanging rear wheel helps with the
favourable weight distribution and reduces the risk of
striking other people compared with a rigid bike.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Custfold, Sep 2000:</EM><BR>
An alternative to the plastic thingy is to modify the thick part of an
Adie handlebar mounted front light bracket -  from the days when all bik
lighs fitted onto a simple standard bracket, the dimensions of which probably
were standardised on the old oil lanterns used on horse drawn carriages.
This conveniently curved part will locate against the seat tube and generally
stay in place.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">S. Joshua Ogawa, Feb 2003:</EM><BR>
Those Taiwanese made Brompton sold in Japan come with a tiny metal piece
on the seat post lever axis that keeps brompton from folding itself when lifted.
It's such a great addition to this  bike but the UK (European) models lack of it
and even in the shop catalogues they are not found.
I decided to draw it with a CAD so that people can bring it to a metal shop to have it made.
It should not cost too much, it's a simple item that can be made even in a home workshop.
<BR>
As there are no many people who can read the CAD files so i made it in
<A HREF="../pictures/josh_fold_stopper.jpg">JPEG format</A>.
If correctly printed it's in scale 1 to 1.
If anyone who wants it in AutoCAD DXF or DWG format I can mail it to him/her.
[Josh's mail address is ogawa.satoshi at chello.be]
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Rainer Zenz, Mar 2003:</EM><BR>
I didn't know of this tiny metal piece, but I have constructed some similar
hooks in autumn. The main difference is: they are mounted vice versa
and I think this is the better solution.
If they fit well, you need just a fingertip to unlock and they lock
automatically (or with another fingertip).
<BR>
Unfortunately my metal shop didn't build the last version for months
(so it WAS my metal shop) and I couldn't test that version,
but there are some photos and drawings from all versions on our site:

Those who have to lug Brommies around airports and so
forth (in hard or soft cases) might want to look at
the dTUBE folding luggage cart.  I just got one to use
on my next trip.  It could be lighter, but maybe only
at some sacrifice of strength;  the design is really
tasty and the quality is reasonably good for the price.
I got mine from a mailorder travelwares catalog.
<BR>
Folded up it looks like a smooth aluminium cylinder with
some hardware along one side.  About the height of a wine
bottle and a similar weight, about the diameter of the
business end of a baseball bat, maybe a little slimmer.
You could definitely find room for it in a mid-size
suitcase, but I plan to stick it in the bike bag when
not in use.
<BR>
Unfolded it looks like a sturdy little alloy luggage cart
with minibungie hold-down straps.  Rated for 60 lb or
so, as I recall.  at first glance you wonder how the
heck it unfolds, but it's actually simple when you
know the steps (like the bike).
<LI><EM CLASS="from">De Clarke, Oct 1999:</EM><BR>
Well here is my promised report on the DTUBE in
real life, as opposed to the pretty pictures at
the Magellan's catalogue site.
<BR>
On the whole I think it is a successful device.
Having lugged the Brommie (encased) across Keahole
airport (leeward shore of Big Island, Hawai'i) on
a previous trip, I would say *anything* that obviates
that schlep is wonderful.  On this trip I had 4
pcs luggage including the Brommie, total weight
well over 70 lbs.  Whew.
<BR>
The DTUBE unfolds swiftly into its working shape. I
rolled the encased Brommie and a laptop case without
much difficulty.  The Brommie case went on the
platform, secured by the mini-bungie, and the laptop
strap was hooked over the top of the frame, so the
laptop rested against the brommie case.  It wheeled
very easily and I couldn't possibly have handled the
luggage without the cart.
<BR>
A caveat: the wheels are quite small and I had to go
slowly over rough surfaces.  The wheels stand proud of
the frame ends by only a small margin, so the frame
ends will ground and scrape when crossing very small
declivities like (this was annoying) the deeply
recessed grout between floor tiles at baggage claim.
I had to be careful to cross the grout at right
angles: if a wheel slipped into the grout line,
there was a godawful scraping noise and a sudden
braking action :-)
<BR>
The wheels are clearly not going to last forever.
They are already abraded and scuffed by the rough
surface of parking lots and roadways.  I will examine
them closely this weekend and see if they look
replaceable.  I am not sure how long the bungie cord
will live either.  It's fairly slender.
<BR>
You have to be sure to lock all the folding cross
members very firmly in place, particularly those at
the back of the cart.  If not locked with a fair
amount of pressure they will come loose over bumps and
the thing will start to sag.  The reinforcing struts
for the "platform" can bounce out of their locating
notches when this happens, producing a melodious
tinkling (as they drag on the ground) and a quick stop
for repairs.  However, if you solicitously lock each
cross member before proceeding, the cart will hold
together.  There is a warning note about this on
the packaging:  believe it.
<BR>
You can't stand the cart upright unattended with a
tall heavy case (like a Brommie) installed.  At rest
it leans forward, and...  more than once I saw my cart
slowly topple over.  Quickly I learned to wheel it
into contact with a counter or bench before letting go
of the handle.
<BR>
Although the DTUBE unfolds in a jiffy, mine was not
always so willing to fold up again :-) This was a
little stressful at baggage check, since I was trying
to pack it back into the Brommie case which was being
checked -- with 100 anxious people in line behind me
there was considerable pressure to get the damn thing
folded away and stuffed into the bag before putting
the bag on the weighing platform. Of course (Murphy's
law) it would always balk at the final telescoping
action.  Same when getting into ground transport.  I
spent the first 2 miles of the shuttle ride to my
conference in a silent struggle with the DTUBE, while
the shuttle driver grinned and asked me where the heck
I got that funny looking gadget.
<BR>
On the return trip I rearranged the cargo somewhat and
put the DTUBE in my carryon duffel bag.  Thus I could
check the big items and then go wrestle with the DTUBE
in decent privacy :-)  Airport security did not seem
to be alarmed by the big metal cylinder.  The laptop
worried them a lot more.
<BR>
On the whole I still think the DTUBE is a good
design.  My difficulties in getting it to telescope
back down may be due to a deficiency of technique.
I did practise before leaving, but what is easy
to do in one's living room after a good night's
sleep is not always so simple when jetlagged, hungry,
and the cynosure of impatient gazes from all 'round.
<BR>
You simply cannot beat the small size of the folded
package, and for me this is the deciding factor.
Hope this info is useful for anyone trying to decide
whether to buy a DTUBE.  Wheels and a handle built
into your Brommie case would be more convenient,
but if you don't have 'em then this thing works
pretty well.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Gozum WEH, Oct 1999:</EM><BR>
Got mine yesterday and was quite impressed.  The review published here
discussed problems with folding the dtube may stem from not reading
instructions, the assembly collapses when the body is SQUEEZED and handle
folded, these items unlock the pillars.  Its exceedingly compact and well
made.  It reminds me of the mechanics of folding the Brompton, daunting at
first, simple and quick when done right.
<BR>
Its only potential weak point are plastic wheels, however, many wear prone
parts have screwed-on braces and are potentially replacable [bungee cord
and wheels].  The documents state the dTube is gauranteed for the life of
the owner.
<BR>
Worth a look for a compact, portable, and strong hand trolley that can be
placed on the Brompton, its pannier, basket or the modified Topeak Quick
Release rear Rack.

<H3><A NAME="86"></A>Straps to help you carry a Brompton</H3>
<UL>
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Savi Maharaj:</EM><BR>
I'm hoping this will be useful information for people (like me) who
suffer from arm-lengthening problems when carrying the Brompton.  (I
live in a fourth-floor flat in an old building, so this is a subject
close to my heart.)
<BR>
I've started using a shoulder strap which I found on sale at one of
those shops that sell remaindered books, low-price CDs and other cheap
odds and ends.  The strap was marketed as a gadget for travellers, the
kind of thing you see on sale at shops in airports.
<BR>
It looks like this: there is a fabric strap with a metal clip which
goes around the top tube of the bike.  This is connected by an elastic
fabric strap to a loop which goes over the shoulder and is made of a
broad band of fake leather-type material.  It's very comfortable and
seems to work well.  My only concern is that it might soon fall apart --
the materials can't be that great because it only cost 2 quid!
I've only had it for about a week so far.
<BR>
[...] the strap is
called "The Weightlifter" and it comes from:
<TABLE BORDER=1><TR>
<TD>The Go Travel Products Co.
<BR>London
<BR>Fax 0181 906 2245
</TABLE>
PS: I have no financial interest in this gadget.
<BR>
The length is adjustable to some extent.  I've adjusted it to suit
the height I usually carry the bike: my arm is just slightly bent at
the elbow.  By the way, I should have explained, the strap is not
intended to support the bike on its own -- I still hold the bike in my
hand but the strap allows my shoulder to take some of the weight.
According to the package blurb, the elastic part of the strap is
supposed to allow the load to be shifted back and forth between arm
and shoulder (by bending or straightening the arm).  I do sometimes
let the bike hang from the strap for a moment if I need a free hand
for opening doors, etc.
<BR>
One other point that just occurred to me: the fact that the bike
touches me means that this strap would not be very comfortable for
horizontal walking.  The bike would bang against my legs.  (It does
that when I carry it without the strap as well -- I guess my arms
aren't strong enough to hold it away from my body.)  The strap does
help a lot when I'm carrying the folded bike up and down stairs.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Rob Hague/Somerset,UK, Apr 1998:</EM><BR>
I have been using a shoulder strap made by 'Op/Tech USA'. The middle
section is neoprene, with webbing for the ends. I bought it from my local
photography shop. It is intended to be used to carry tripods and comes with
a quick release buckle on each end. With careful adjustment, one end loops
around the folded Brompie hinge and the other end around the seat tube
frame bit... Works great...
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Koichi Yoshino, Nov 1999:</EM><BR>
Hello. I use a strap for cooler box. I bought it at a outdoor store for
about 9 dollars. It says it can hold about 50Kg. Both ends are adjustable
and have plastic hooks. Strap is mede of nylon. I fix one end to the head
tube and the other end to the seat post. It doesn't damage the bike frame at
all. And I can carry my bike very easily.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Erwin de Vries, Sep 2000:</EM><BR>
I've made a hook to keep up the rear end of the bike, because I carry my luggage on the back of the Brompton.
I took a 4mm thick iron rod (with a plastic outer cover) which is bent to go around the seatpost, then slightly to the rear, and then projects downwards and forms a hook around the top bit of the rear triangle, near the rubber suspension block. No scratching of seatpost/triangle because of the plastic outer layer.
I've made the hook just tight enough to grip the triangle when I'm not sitting on the bike. Unhooking the rear can easily be done when the suspension block is compressed a bit (sitting or leaning on the saddle).

<UL>
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Channell Wasson:</EM><BR>
A dry bag [Ortlieb X-tremer] is now available for the Brompton which has straps to allow it
to be carried as a knap sack.  It is completely water proof and quite
comfortable when used on one's back for carrying the Brompton.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Frank Tompson, Jun 1998:</EM><BR>
I bought a very basic big plastic woven bag (red/white/blue check
design) with a zip top and 2 carry handles in a market yesterday. It is
a bit of a squeeze, and frustratingly is not quite big enough to enclose
the whole bike (at least with a rack fitted) as the saddle and the
handlebar stem hinge/front carrier block project above the zip line.
However, it gets you 90% of the way there, and would be good enough to
tidy things up sufficiently to save you getting slung out of the saloon
bar of the pub.
<BR>
The carry handles actually go all the way under the bag and up the other
side, so although it all looks very flimsy, it seems to be fairly
robust, while at the same time being very light, folds small, and at UK
1.50 pounds (say, US2.50 dollars) hardly breaks the bank. Carrying is
somewhat easier than by the saddle or the frame.
<BR>
I saw these when I was in Australia recently and suspect they might be
manufactured somewhere in the third world, so they might be available
fairly widely.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">David Henshaw - A to B Magazine, Jun 98:</EM><BR>
We've come across these before - they will just take an 'L' type with
standard seat pillar, and are available in a lot of markets and other
places for 1.50 or less... excellent value. I think they're called Parrot
Brand, and I seem to recall they're made in China.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Dave H, Jun 1998:</EM><BR>
We found these to be the universal Chairman Mao suitcase for carrying the
spare universal Chairman Mao change of suit in China in 1988, they are
very versatile, and began appearing in the West around 1990 ISTR.
Various sizes are available.  The stitching and zip are a little weak, and
the material can fray if seams are damaged, or a serious cut occurs.
Warning in China/HK do make sure you can identify your bag - a bit like
finding your Brompton at a Transport Conference :-)
<BR>
Meantime at Custom Folder we're making a Brompton sized shoulder bag (like
posties sack) for &pound;39.98 and a very basic shoulder strap and attaching
slings to slip over the saddle and front hinge and carry the bike on
a strap over your shoulder (&pound;12.50).
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Ian R. Platt, Feb 1999:</EM><BR>
The Taiwan Neobike version has a
shoulder bag that looks OK, it matches the black covers on the UK
models in looks, but I don't know about the details of the fabric as I
have no experience of one. They are priced at 6,000 Japanese yen here
(=GBP 30) If required, I could make further enquiries.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Custfold, Feb 1999:</EM><BR>
Ortlieb produce a stuff sack which is intended for canoe expeditions, as do
Mad River Canoe (in their Voyageur Range) - Channell sells the Ortlieb,
although attempts to track this mega-bag down for UK sale have been difficult,
as the UK ranges seems not to get such a large item.  The bag has roll-down
seal and is nominally watertight with welded seams - the degree to which it
will float is not known.
<BR>
I would like to find a slightly different proportion of York Box - of which
the current York 200 makes a fine folding trailer & rucksack, seat (for 2
waiting at an station), floats with up to 200lb inside, and carries a spare
Brompton inside (as shown to Bicycle Doctor in Mcr) but with the lid off as
the shape is not quite right.  The York 80 makes a fine watertight and
floating front pannier and it is really frustrating that the economics of
importing them is so poor (they take up a lot of volume for very little
weight, and freight charges are based on an optimum density - so I'd pay 100%
charge for something which in theory was only 5-10% of the potential
consignable load.  We might get something but....
<BR>
If any Transpond travellers are wanting a useful item to bring over to Europe
then pack your stuff in a York 80, which is exactly the size limit for going
in the overhead lockers and can be easily fastened to the Bromptom pannier
frame.  But if carrying one full of papers you'll need to beef up the front
block fixings (they are only rated at 16Kg against 30+Kg with the box) - You
got home with stuff in the soft holdall you put in the box.
<BR>
Meantime a very effective way of carrying the Brompton is to use the newspaper
delivery bag (a larger version of what bike couriers use) - we have made some
enhanced versions selling for around &pound;40 with slightly looser dimensions and
full velcro shut flap and will make more once we have moved in to new premises
(next week we hope)  Our s-mail - send SAE for pic.  Tightwads might try their
local free paper and buy a bright yellow or orange bag with printed name - 2-3
super hot washes removes this - at a cost of around &pound;5, or mugging/bribing the
paper boy to win one.  It isn't perfect - the fit is tight, and you need at
least 1 strap to tie the flap over but it works.

There's also the slightly mysterious Carradice "Brompton Carrying Bag",
a limited offer advertised in "A to B" issue 12. Is it the one shown at
the Cycling & Leisure Exhibition, NEC 1
March 1999 <A HREF="http://www.whooper.demon.co.uk/foldsoc/cycleis.html">http://www.whooper.demon.co.uk/foldsoc/cycleis.html</A>?
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Ian Charles, Aug 1999:</EM><BR>
I don't know if it was the one shown at the Cycle & Leisure Exhibition but I
bought two last week for our Brommies and so far they seem to be very
effective and a significant improvement over the original bag, albeit at an
extortionate price (I did however manage to negotiate a ten percent
discount). I bought them through the ad in A2B.
<BR>
Main advantages - carrying: the support strap is well placed to enable the
weight to be 'shared' between the arm and the shoulder; and fitting: the
all-round zip makes it much easier to put on and remove.
<BR>
It doesn't fit as tightly as the original which in some circumstances can be
a disadvantage. For example, we're taking the bikes in the car on holiday
and want to cover them but will not be carrying them. The closer fitting
'original' bags will be used on this occasion. On the other hand, the space
may provide us with the opportunity, long considered, to find some
inflatable material, such as a couple of pillows, which could be inserted
between the bike and the bag and thus provide lightweight protection when
travelling by air (despite the reassuring experiences recently contributed,
we've often suffered minor breakages and damage)
<BR>
I suppose compared to the fragile-looking jacket at over five times the
price, which someone in a bike shop tried to sell me the other day as the
only way to stay dry when it rains, the new Carradice bag may not be such
bad value after all.

The airline gave me no grief on the return trip with
the brommie safely in a cordura bag that I got (used)
from Channell.  I checked it as a suitcase with no
questions asked.  However, the brommie and bag, even
with shoulder strap, was a monstrous burden to lug
around the airport after reclaiming it from baggage
check.  I really can't carry it very far, so will have
to fit wheels to the case or else invest in one of
the recent dinky luggage carts that fold up to teeny
size (and could be stored in the bag with the bike
when not used).

On a recent trip to New York I took a large rucksack and managed to wedge it
diagonally from the rack up against the seat post, secured with the bungees.
The machine was a little top have when pushing by hand, but the overall ride
quality was acceptable.  For shorter distances I carried it on my shoulders.
Personally I think a decent rucksack is far more practical than a suitcase.

I tried the Ortlieb pack and returned it to Channell.
It was the dickens of a job fitting the bike into the
pack, and then getting it out again.  I couldn't
see undertaking this struggle at a bus stop.  Channell
says that if you pre-bag the bike in slick nylon fabric
it is easier... still seems like major hassle.
<BR>
Once stuffed into the pack, it's a rather unwieldy and
heavy load (well, I'm fairly short) and doesn't ride well
on the back.  My back anyway.  The straps weren't too
comfy, considering the weight of the Brom.  If you are
quite tall, broad in the shoulders, and strong, then it
might work for you.

The new Carradice bag is very good - it's not a back pack but a shoulder
bag. It has a very well-positioned hand grip to take the strain off the
shoulder and the all-round double zip makes it very easy to put on the bike.
I haven't taken it by plane yet (plan to do so in a week or two) but I think
that there is enough room to put one's clothes on the outside to act as
padding.

The Taiwanese Brompton also has a shoulder bag that looks good. it costs
about &yen;4,000 (approx &pound;20) here in Tokyo, I think. I guess they would be

<LI><EM CLASS="from">Mccoy, Andrew, Oct 1999:</EM><BR>
I have a Taiwanese Brompton and Bag.  The bag is attractive, but not
terribly useful for carrying the bike any distance, neither is it useful for
checking as luggage on planes.
<BR>
The problem with carrying is that the Brompton is just too bulky to
comfortably carry on a shoulder strap - there is always some part of the
folded bike trying to attack another part of your anatomy.  Most successful
is to attach the shoulder strap to the folded bike, leaving the bag's zipper
partially open at the top.  At least then the bike is not "flopping about"
inside the bag as it is being carried.  It's still awkward to carry though.
<BR>
In terms of using the bag to check onto a plane as luggage, the bag is not
tough enough, and holes will appear where the bike rubs through to adjacent
luggage as the plane vibrates its way across the miles while the Brompton
snoozes in the hold.  This problem could probably be used by the application
of  bubble wrap to the bike inside the bag.  Also the airline handlers
managed to bend one of the zippers on the bag pocket, so that no longer
works either.  IMHO, the problem of rough airline handlers can never be
solved!  As an aside, the Taiwanese Brompton uses a pressed metal clip to
hold the fold closed.  This clip was bent out of shape and also stripped a
considerable quantity of paint from the stay on the bike during the
aformentioned plane journeys.
<BR>
The bag does look good, and it is very impressive to rock-up to a new place
with the bike enclosed and then proceed to remove the bike, unfold, fold the
carry bag into the mini seat-pack bag and ride away.  Observers are so
stunned they almost applaud!
<BR>
For those trying to disguise the Brompton on a train or in a building this
bag could well be the answer.  Although the big red BROMPTON logo may be
something of a give away to astute observers.......

I also have a Taiwanese Bag. But I rarely use it because it's a little heavy
to carry around. When I need to disguise my bike, I use a shoulder strap and
UK cover that has no flap but a rectangle hole on its top. The hole is wider
than flap hole. The shoulder strap is attached to the folded bike directly.
So I can also hold the flame from the top hole of the cover. And I can roll
it steering with the shoulder strap. It is pretty comfortable.

The [bag] I received first [in error] is very much like the Carradice
[with top zip and shoulder strap],
slightly less convenient to use, and not fitting as tight (although as
has been pointed out, this could be an advantage if you want to put more
padding in or carry clothes etc), and it also has a small zipped side
pocket. I was charged about 26 UK pounds including delivery which makes
it less than half the price of the Carradice.
<BR>
The correct (rucksack) bag I ordered from Dahon has now arrived and I'd
like to offer a few comments, although others I know such as Olivier
have used it far more extensively.
<BR>
The quality seems to be fine as far as I can see and it looks reasonably
waterproof. At under 30 UK pounds, it seems very good value. I know the
Carradice has come down a lot in price and is now around 34 pounds, but
the Dahon does offer quite a lot more.
<BR>
Like the Carradice, it zips all round and has a good single shoulder
strap and two carrying handles, but not the tension handle which eases
the weight when using the shoulder strap. However, this probably doesn't
matter much because in addition, of course, it has back (rucksack-type)
straps and a chest strap to go between them which helps to stabilise the
rather unwieldy package when carried this way. Furthermore, it has an
internal pocket and also an external pocket which doubles as the
carrying pack when the bag is folded - and even comes with hip belt. All
in all, a good product and I think relatively good value for money.
<BR>
Apart from wishing I had some better skills at origami getting it to
fold into itself in the hip bag, I have one further observation on its
use: the plethora of handles, straps etc would need to be dealt with
(taped or tied down) if it was being used to transport the bike by air.
If that was the only use to which I was putting the bag, and was likely
to carry it on my back, I think the original B bag or the Carradice
would be more convenient.
<BR>
And Olivier was of course correct - the smallest (16 inch) size is just
right, tight but not too tight in places, and a little loose in others
which means clothes can be included. I haven't carried it a long
distance yet but it would seem to me that one should put the bike in the
bag with the handlebar rather than the folding pedal facing one's back.
Anyone with a bad back should also bear in mind that it's OK once on the
back, but lifting it and getting into position without assistance could
be a little painful. But overall it seems to me, having had both the
Carradice and the original B bags, that this one is just as good, more
versatile in many ways and only moderately less convenient in others.

peeks out of the package and leaves lube stains (unless it's covered,

have decent castors so you can always roll it.

This is why some people mount in-line skate wheels instead of
the standard castors.  They have a larger diameter, so that the front
wheel is lifted from the ground, and obviously roll better.  You can
push the folder by the saddle without lifting anything, and steer by
applying sideways force.  Once the castors are aligned properly, the
folded package will roll in a straight line so you can button your coat
while you approach the unfolding site (AKA the launch ramp :^)

I found this "front wheel contacts the ground" a problem too.  I stuck a bit of
wood to the underside of the frame where it touches the back wheel when folded.
This raises the frame, and thus the front wheel, allowing free pulling.  Not
elegant, but it works.  You also need to rotate the plastic thingy that, with
the seat post, locks the folded bike together.

[...] an adapted set of lineskate wheels, which can be fitted with no
additional parts or machining to a Brompton T model.

The first production models are now out to the public - I'm doing an
introductory price until November - can s-mail details.  If demand reaches
appropriate levels the kit will be packaged and available widely through
retailers.
<BR>
Have just checked the width of the wheels which replace those odd shaped
rollers that used to catch my heels (usually its women who have the problem
as they cycle with feet closer in).  The OEM width is 155mm, the kit width is
just under 140mm, an that include projecting bolt heads at approx 4mm each
side - a dome cap socket screw can be substituted at small extra cost.
<BR>
I have also thought through a method of providing a 4 wheel kit for the L
model, and hope to be working on this early in October - suffice to say there
will be a Y bar with the 2 wheels which fits in place of the single castor
once a neat bracket is sorted out.

<BR>Well it seems to - on a smooth surface, if you're going off-road,
dragging the Brompton around I'd suggest fitting the 72mm wheels
instead of the 64mm ones which are double the price to buy and a bit
wider (doesn't affect 140mm dimension though).
My seatpost will catch if pushed right in.
<LI>Does it come with all spacers and screws and requires no drilling?

(To fit wheels directly the rack will need drilling out for 6mm - M6 -bolts,
may require lights to be re-seated,
and also have a front roller width of over 160mm).
<P>
My experience, and reports form users is that once fitted
the bike then needs a brake to park it when folded - usually achieved by
dropping the seatpost down a bit further, or fitting a 1" rubber bung in the
bottom (extending post).  The standard kit uses slimline black 64mm wheels,
although clear 72mm wheels can be used at extra cost - approx #1/wheel.
<BR>
The fitted bike will travel over a smooth surface for great distances, and
usually gets rolling on as little as 4% gradients.   With a high saddle I
usually push on this, but the kit will allow the bike to run on the rear set
only holding the saddle slightly higher, and under its nose.

I fitted some inline skate wheels in stead of the rollers: nice
idea, but unless you're crossing a billiard table...
<BR>
I could only get 1.7cm thick wheels and standard diameter (about 6.
5cm? - I can't remember at the moment), each of which have two
bearings, one each side of the wheel.  Yes, they stick out a bit, but
they do allow the beast to roll across normal pavements.  They are
the usual, cheap ones, i.e. 'hard'.  They haven't caused the bike to
run away yet.  Any other type seem to be on an exponential rate of
costs. I have yet to get the bung for the bottom of the seat pillar
to provide a brake for the machine, the shop has been shut for the
last two days. I shall continue to search for thinner wheels, if they
are not more expensive.
Total cost, wheels + bearings: &pound;8.
<BR>
The axle sizes of the wheel bearings was slightly larger than the
diameter of the bolts which needed to be a bit longer than the
originals on each case.  I used thin-walled plastic tubing (the heat-
shrink type (very thin-walled) in one case, and some used 'normal'
tubing on the other.  It seemed to beef up the axles for the wheels
just enough.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Custfold, Sep 1998:</EM><BR>
That is because the normal way to fit these in lineskates is by putting an
axle sleeve through the wheel and the bearings onto the sleeve, the bolt (M6)
then passes through the sleeve in a well known engineering method of fixing
bearings to provide rigidity without undesirable forces from tightening the
wrong bits against each other.  We use standard sleeve system on our
skatewheel conversion kit, but as there is no need for 2 bearings in the duty
that we use it for, we save weight (4 less bearings), and reduce the width of
the front rollers by 15mm.  Our wheels are not the cheaper 1 piece units as
the bearings are not a good fit and the fixing system we use works a lot
better with the CalPro units.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Elaine Sewell, Sep 1998:</EM><BR>
You can buy two things from skate shops to remedy the problem of larger
diameter bearing holes.
The first is a thing called a "top hat" which is top hat shaped (strange
that !) piece of plastic and presses into the bearings, you need two per
wheel (one for each bearing).
The second is simply an aluminium sleeve that fits between the bearings.

A few weeks ago, I fitted a Dave Holladay set of skate wheels to my Brompton

it falling on to its side by yanking up the rope to suspend the bicycle.

It occurred to me that Doggie Technology might be the answer.  Were I to get
hold of the handle used by blind people to control their guide dogs, I could
then get hold of a small dog collar which would slide over the nose of the

along without having to stoop too low and also the rigid handle would give
me a better degree of control over the stability of the bike.

I would like to draw everybody's attention to the danger of jumping off
your bike in a rush.
A few days ago I was hurrying to catch a suburban train, so I stopped at
the station the following way: at a more or less reduced speed (I was
already on the sidewalk) I braked and jumped off the bike in the same
moment. Result: since my weight was not keeping it down any longer, the
rear wheel assembly swang around and swapped into parked position with such
force that when landing a piece of one of the small plastic wheels broke
off. I wonder why these small wheels are made from plastic and not rubber,
in which case not only would they not break so easily but it would be also
more convenient to drag the bicycle in a folded position. I wonder also why
the Brompton manual does not warn the user to be careful when stopping.

chromo-plastic guard have lasted 4 years of hard use in all weathers.The
spring in the stays protects the guard/fender but it is tempting to fold
with a flourish which does the damage. I also found that the frame
mini-wheels soon got splayed after going in the luggage to the States.
Judiciously bending them out restored a bit of castor action on ultra
smooth surfaces.

Fender/mudguards are not generally a problem on the British-made
Brompton. A deliberate decision was made to use light fender stays that
would bend, but not be destroyed, in the event of over-enthusiastic
folding, or every day airline handling.
The stays get bent fairly easily, but they're easy to bend out, by
applying even pressure on both sides at once. They should last for years -
my six year old bike, with 15,000 miles on the clock has just had new
stays fitted because the mudguard eventually cracked up. If you are
bending the stays regularly, I'm afraid you're being too brutal in the
fold!
1998 Bromptons have a different fender/mudguard/stay assembly (the old
supplier went bust) that has yet to be tested. I have very little
knowledge about the Taiwanese bike, except that Brompton are very
concerned about the quality and attention to detail.

<EM CLASS="from">Anthony Cartmell:</EM><BR>
The curved frame tubes on the rear frame which support the little wheels
closest to the suspension rubber have got bent on my Brompton.  I think
it was caused by my sitting on the folded package while waiting for
trains.  I have managed to straighten them a little but they must still
be a bit on the weak side.  The result is a not-quite-so-stable parking
position which can cause problems with a heavy front bag!

Yes, the same thing happened to me after about four years of daily commuting
by train. One of the tubes eventually snapped off.
This made the folded bike unstable and it would fall over
when the train stopped.
I made some enquiries about brazing it back on but was told
(correctly or not, I don't know)
that it would be difficult to align a repair and make a strong
joint.  I therefore forked out &pound;50 (fifty pounds sterling)
for a new rear fork assembly, which was superior to the original
in having the properly aligned little pulley wheels for the 5
speed hub gear which is now trouble-free, something that the old one
never was.  However, it might have been nicer to have hung on
to the 50 quid, or bought a front bag instead.  It never
occurred to me that sitting on the saddle of the bike when folded
may have caused it.

Suggest you go to a hardware store (iron monger)
and buy a six inch nipple of 1/2" id galvanized pipe.  Remove the caster
wheels and then slip the pipe(nipple) over the bent wheel stay and straighten
it by eye.  On the new Bromptons this wheel mount stay seems to be beefed up
a bit.  If you have bent the new style, you will need a larger inside
diameter pipe to make the repair.  Hope you can make sense of this.
