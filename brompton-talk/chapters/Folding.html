<H2><A NAME="78"></A>Handlebars suddenly flipping open while folded</H2>
<EM CLASS="from">Doug Faunt:</EM><BR>
The bike folds fully, and the clip fully engages, it just doesn't hold
under any kind of stress.  It's pretty loose, in the best of
circumstances.
<UL>
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Anthony Cartmell:</EM><BR>
I have has several embarrassing moments when the handlebars decide to
unfold, usually hitting someone as I'm clambering aboard a train.  I
have had some success with strengthening the frame clip by threading an
old spoke through its holes and twisting the ends together.  The spoke
wire makes a round-ish O shape which has plenty of spring in it.  I
reckon a re-design of the clip would be a good idea, as it relies on a
very narrow part of the plastic which wears quickly.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Mark James:</EM><BR>
If you use bar ends (<A CLASS="quick" HREF="Handlebars.html#bar_ends">Spotlight on handlebars - Bar ends</A>) that solves the folding problem
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Dave Holladay, Oct 1997:</EM><BR>
There is also a neat little transporting the bike trick which avoids the
flapping 'bars problem, I found out when folding the black 1(2 with foot &
finger) speed machine.  A pannier shock cord loop fitted under the clip for
the gear changer, with the Custom Folder swing under stop strap,
will neatly link together as a positive closure.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">David Hansen, Jan 1998:</EM><BR>
If you look at where the handlebars clip into the folded bike you
will see a U shaped bit of plastic on the bike, and a round shaped
bit of plastic on the handlebar stem. The round bit of plastic should
strike both sides of the U shaped bit at the same time while being
folded. If they do not then this may be the cause of the problem.
Rotate the U shaped bit until the round bit strikes squarely (you
will hopefully need to unfasten it to do so).
<BR>
Alternatively the U shaped bit of plastic may have been weakened and
so allowing the round bit to slip out. A bent piece of springy wire
inserted into the holes in the U shaped bit will hold the two halves
of the U together and so help prevent unclipping.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Nico J. de Boer, Feb 2000:</EM><BR>
Even better: take about 3" of the threaded end of an old (or new) spoke,
and bend it into the abovementioned "flat-bottomed U shape":
<BR>
The width of the "legs" should be a little (1mm, 1/32") less than the
distance of the holes in the fitting. The length of the legs equals the
height of the fitting. Insert it from below, and secure it by screwing
on the spoke screw (the T in my figure). In this way, no excess sharp
ends stick out from the fitting. Also you can easily bend it a bit
narrower.
(I've got the idea comes from the Brompton specialist at Roelofs Bike
Shop in Arnhem, The Netherlands.)
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Custfold, Jan 1998:</EM><BR>
The clip usually weakens and breaks after use over many years or in cold
weather.  One option is to copy the Cresswell and fit a plastic pipe clip
(15mm) - trimmed slightly and screwed onto the steerer stem, with the old
capscrew in the old hole.
<BR>
To further secure the bars it would appear that the fitting of a pannier shock
cord under the gear changer clip, and either hooking it into the spokes of the
front wheel, or as I discovered - combining this with the anti fold under
strap, the clip can hook into the strap and hold the whole bike as a unit -
when the bent bit of the front mudguard stay which can gradually un-bend (see
Jane Thomas's note) ceases to clip over.  I've made a separate clip which
stays on the axle to do this on all my bikes.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Custfold, Mar 1998:</EM><BR>
The performance of the front clip which retains the bars will deteriorate, as
it depends on a very thin section of plastic to give it a 'spring' around the
bung which seats into it (Design students of synectics bent might find analogy
of a cruder natural occurrence in interlocking components).
<BR>
From early days Brompton users have developed options to combat this
<OL>
<LI>using heavy wire - fashion a supporting spring clip which fits into the
existing holes - the old style toilet roll holders (back of stall door/Mk 1 BR
coaches etc) are exactly the right gauge wire.
<LI>make/buy the Grigsby special clip - Avon Valley Cyclery - see A2B
<LI>fit the anti fold-under strap plus a shock cord under the gear changer and
clip them together when the bike is folded, remove the 2 plastic parts and
accessories to balance weight increase and reduction. (both Custom Folder
bits)
<LI>follow style of Cresswell Micro, and remove plastic parts, before fitting a
15mm pipe clip (trimmed slightly) to engage with the cap screw in the fork
crown.
</OL>
The deterioration of the clip is advanced if the plastic female part on the
forks is loosened or knocked such that the line is not square with the male
part on the steerer (very common), or the male part is knocked round on its
thread, or fiddled with (it adjusts in & out on the thread)
<BR>
BTW the Brompton does make a nice seat with a back rest if the handlebars are
folded down and the frame propped (my bikes have bars which touch the ground -
and stubbies should have same effect) one can then sit along the main frame
and lean back against the seatpost, with room for a second person in extremis
on the frame and possibly someone small on the rear T carrier ......
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Erwin de Vries, May 2000:</EM><BR>
Alternatively, use a plastic tie-rap, which you put through the holes in the handlebar catch.
You can tighten it click by click until it holds the nipple just right,
therefore easier to adjust than using a spoke.
Added bonus: put a rubber O-ring between the frame and the handlebar catch,
and do not overtighten the allen bolt.
This makes it possible for the catch to align itself to a certain degree.
Otherwise, slightly misaligned catches sometimes break in two,
I am told by experienced Bromptoneers.
<UL>
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Nico J. de Boer, May 2000:</EM><BR>
However, tie-wraps tend to break after a year (daily folding/unfolding),
while a bit of spoke might hold out longer (currently being tested).

<H2><A NAME="79"></A>Frequent Folding fosters Frame Flange Failure?</H2>
<EM CLASS="from">john blackburn, Feb 1999:</EM><BR>
How many times can you fold a Brompton? Each time the screw is tightened
in the frame folding flange, the threaded hole gets a little more worn.
It would be better if the wear occurred in the bolt alone; this could
then be replaced as required.
<BR>
As an experiment, I got a new bolt (M8 x 75mm, high-tensile steel to
spec 8.8), and 2 8mm full nuts and changed the system to a captive
thumb-wheel that runs along the bolt, which is screwed and locked into
the threaded hole in the frame. One of the 8mm nuts is nested in the hex
hole in the thumb-wheel (the existing M8 x 50 HT bolt can be eased out
carefully), and the other 8mm nut is used as a lock-nut to stop the bolt
rotating. The existing washers were retained and used exactly as before.
<BR>
The result is a captive thumb-wheel that cannot vibrate out or be
stolen, and a bolt that can be tightened as often as necessary without
damage to the frame.
<BR>
It doesn't look too good; maybe there is a better method of more elegant
appearance. But the existing system - screwing a screw into a tapped
hole in an expensive frame thousands of times and not expecting trouble -
doesn't seem too good either. Nor does the idea of folding the machine
dozens of times a day and leaping onto passing buses. Now if it were
made of magnesium alloy with nylon wheels and weighed 3kg...
<UL>
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Roland Elsenberg, Feb 1999:</EM><BR>
Mine had at least four folds and unfolds each day for four years. On some
days
many, many more. Hinges, threads, bolts and clamps still work well, although
I have
read advice to change the clamps. The only wear due to the process of
folding so
far is in the clamp and plastic part locking the seatpost.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Custfold, Feb 1999:</EM><BR>
The hinge component that fails first is the pivot pin (an interference fit
roll pin) - with my frequent frame rebuilding I note that both my steerer hing
pins (7 and 1 speed bikes) keep coming out and have to be whacked in with a
heavy hard object when the sloppy handlebar becomes too frightening to ride.
<BR>
I did use a 6mm bolt once.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Phil Gough, Feb 1999:</EM><BR>
I don't think it's something to worry about.  My T5 has had 10 years of daily folding (250 working days a year so between seven and eight thousand folding operations.  The wire clip on the front mudguard stay that locks onto the rear chainstay is very tired now, and I've got through 3 of those plastic handlebar locking clips.  That is a part that could do with beefing up.
</UL>

<H2><A NAME="80"></A>Is there a preferred gear to select before folding?</H2>
<EM CLASS="from">Robert Payne, Mar 1999:</EM><BR>
I've heard many different statements about what gear to leave your bike
in when folding (2, 3 and 5).
<BR>
Which one is optimal?
<BR>
I've been leaving the bike in 3rd when it is folded.  Is folding in 5th
going to save me trouble with adjustments?
<UL>
<LI><EM CLASS="from">David Hansen, Mar 1999:</EM><BR>
Optimal to avoid stretching the
gear cable and so causing adjustment problems, top.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Mike Hessey, May 2000:</EM><BR>
If you have
one of the old 5-speed models with twin cable, then the left hand lever
should be in the upper position to reduce cable tension.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Jonathan Brickley, May 2000:</EM><BR>
I find it's best to be in second for speed of folding as the pedals whizz
round to the correct position without dragging the chain tensioner device
with it,and pulling off the chain>Mine's a 5 speed with 300 miles on the
clock, maybe it will loosen up in time

<H2><A NAME="81"></A>Coping with passers-by: "how much does it cost?"</H2>
<EM CLASS="from">Peter O'Reilly, Jul 2000:</EM><BR>
While with the Brompton, I am frequently asked the question, "How much does
it cost?" It is by far the most common question asked.  At first it was a
bit humoring to see the incredulous expression on ones face when they find
out it costs more than  say a couple of hundred dollars (or any bicycle for
that).
<BR>
Frequency aside, I do mind it a bit when asked such by a stranger on the
street.  "Bike jacking" is not such an uncommon thing here in NYC.  It's not
the only thought that pops into my head when asked.  Your opinion may
differ, but asking indiscriminately such a question to me is like asking
"How much money do you have in your wallet?" Yes, I am aware, for most it is
out of genuine curiosity, but it seems rather crude to ask.  When asked
sometimes I will tell the true cost other times I will give a low ball
figure.
<UL>
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Stephen W. Butler, Jul 2000:</EM><BR>
I have heard that Rockefeller, annoyed by frequent questions as to how much his yacht cost,
would reply "If you have to ask, you can't afford it".
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Ka Lun Tam, Jul 2000:</EM><BR>
I have definitely been asked that question on numerous occasions.  Obviously,
if it's someone I know, I will be honest with them.  If it's someone in a
bike shop, I might tell them outright too.
<BR>
If it's a total stranger on the street, however, what I normally say is that
they can buy a folding bike for anything from $200 to $2000 or more, depending
on what features they want, how comfortable, etc.  I then tell them I spent a
little more on mine because I had it customized to match my specific
measurements requirements.  Ultimately, however, I never actually say how much
my specific Brompton cost.
<BR>
My answer, I feel, tells them how much a generic folder could cost and
might even get them interested in getting an inexpensive folder whereas
the real cost of a Brompton could scare people away from the folding
experience.  By telling them that this bike is made to my specs, I'm hoping
to make it appear that its value is a lot lower to anyone else, because it
was really designed specifically for me.
<BR>
I don't know if any of this works, but I haven't had my B ripped off
me yet! :)
<LI><EM CLASS="from">John R. Bolt, Jul 2000:</EM><BR>
I used to be more polite that I am now, and say "well, I can tell you
they don't give them away." Nowadays, though, unless the questioner
looks like someone who might tear me limb from limb, I just tell them
flat out that that is an impolite question and it is none of their
business. If I want to save my skin, I will say "a few hundred dollars"
and let it go at that.
