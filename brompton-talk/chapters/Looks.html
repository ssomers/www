<EM CLASS="from">brammonique, Jun 2000:</EM><BR>
I am an avid user of the brompton T3,
and I like the looks of the bike's design (all black), but there is one
thing I hate to look at.
And that is the incredebly dull looking gray/silver mudguards .
I like to replace them for some carbonfiber look black ones.
<BR>
Is there anyone who knows where to get them?
<UL>
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Mark West, Jun 2000:</EM><BR>
No but I can supply a 'carbon fibre style' self adhesive film which
can be applied to the existing mudguards. The film is about 50 microns
thick so it adds very little weight to the bike. you would need about
half a metre at most with lots left for other things or repairs I
estimate cost at about &pound;5.00 sterling per metre plus carriage which I
would need to find out.

<H2><A NAME="148"></A>Damaged Brompton sticker</H2>
<EM CLASS="from">Mark Maier, Aug 1998:</EM><BR>
My Brompton sticker on the main frame was damaged severely
so I took it off. Now the bike looks nice and "clean", but I started
getting questions like "Is this a Brompton?" with a sceptic glance I
interprete as "Is it stolen?" so I am thinking about putting it back
on. Is there any scource for these stickers? If possible, I would
prefer it smaller than the standard +/- 30 cm long one...

I've known of Dutch owners get new frame stickers from their dealer, for a
small charge.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Custfold@aol.com, Sep 1998:</EM><BR>
I have an arrangement with Andrew - my bike has no indication that Brompton
have made it - just in case it snaps in an embarrassing place - I wonder if,
like Rolls Royces, broken down Bromptons are spirited away for repair.  Black
stickers on red bikes red stickers on black bikes, and white on Dutch ones
AFAIK.  By leaving the stickers off you should save 0.5gm on the weight of the
bike.

<LI><EM CLASS="from">Channell Wasson:</EM><BR>
you might stop by a nail salon and get some matching red polish.
A hardware store would have a small can of black glossy paint
for the rest of the Brompton.
Also buy a small artist's brush at the same store
and slovent to clean the brush.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Ian Charles, Oct 1999:</EM><BR>
For the paintwork I use car 'touch up' paint, the type that comes with a
brush in the tube and would normally be used (on a car) for stone chips
etc. Seems to work fine although admittedly my bike is not as new as
yours and if it were, I might take more trouble to get a perfect match.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Bob Gelman, Oct 1999:</EM><BR>
On the subject of touch-up paint, nail polish comes in lots of shades, is
cheap and readily available, and works well.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">David Edge, Oct 1999:</EM><BR>
Nicola at the factory tells me that only Holts CT100 gloss black (a
motor-car touch-up paint) really matches the powder coat well. Goodness
only knows if that is available on your side of the pond - I haven't found
it in the UK yet.

<H2><A NAME="150"></A>National colours</H2>
<EM CLASS="from">Nico J. de Boer, Aug 1998:</EM><BR>
It appeared that blue+black is a
custom colour in the UK, while it is one of the "standard" colours in
the Netherlands. The Dutch "special" red+black edition of my girlfriend
happened to be a "standard" colour in the UK!
[...]
UK standard colours apparently are all black, and red+black,
the Dutch are blue+black and red+white.
<UL>
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Roland Elsenberg, Aug 1998:</EM><BR>
I bought my first one in
the Netherlands [...] in 94. Then there
were red/black (front red, main black) and all-black Bromptons standard. One
yellow/black was availiable at extra cost.
<BR>
Standard colours in Germany are currently all-black and all-red.   Yellow
and white are optional. As Brompton was ADFC-Bicycle of the year in 97, a
special edition in green was availiable.
<LI>
Most popular in Belgium is blue+black

<H2><A NAME="151"></A>Frame numbers</H2>
The frame number is on the little platform linking the seat tube and the rear triangle hinge.

BS6102 is the British Standard for cycles.
