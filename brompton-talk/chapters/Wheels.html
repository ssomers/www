Broken spokes on pre 1990 Bromptons were a problem it seems, my early wheels
did fail this way, but rebuilds and new wheels much better,  SA hubs are
designed for 13swg spokes.  Note thatb the old front hub and SA rear ended up
with spokes the same length when front was switched to radial spoking -
useful for spares.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Mike Hessey:</EM><BR>
[...] a number of broken spokes in the
FRONT wheel over the last few months. My front wheel had less spokes
than are standard - I've replaced the front wheel after this problem,
and it's now fine.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Clive Page, Mar 1998:</EM><BR>
I've had spokes break every month or two for the life of my Brompton, now
over 6 years old.  It's always on the rear wheel, and those under tension
when you pedal.   I now never start in 1st gear (of 5-speed) and try to
tension them evenly, but it still happens.   I consulted Messrs Brompton
and was told that newer models have stronger spokes but, unfortunately,
these require a different rim.   I was about to buy a new rim and spokes
when I saw messages here recently saying that the latest type of rim
suffers from rather rapid wear.   So I guess I'll just put up with
replacing them every few weeks.  But it's a real design fault, in my
opinion, in nearly all other respects the Brompton is very well
engineered.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Channell Wasson, Mar 1998:</EM><BR>
I ride my Brompton every day and often pull a trailer with a heavy
load. I have broken two spokes in about 4 years.  Both were on rear
wheel.  I at first agonized about getting the right guage replacement
spokes and worked hard to find a shop that could cut to length and roll
on the proper thread for the spoke nipple I had.  This all was going
nowhere so I simply bought two spokes with new nipples which happened to
be of smaller guage than the 13g Brompton spoke. I took them home in my
Brompton pannier, entered my tool room and cut them to a useful length
with enough left over to bend a hook in one end so that the spoke would
properly hold in the hub. The job took about 10 minutes. The replacement
spokes have been installed for about 2 years and are still just fine.
Recently, however, I replaced my rear rim because it had a wall crack.
Maybe I hit a pot hole too hard and weakened the rim. The rim didn't
seem to be worn excessively thin from braking friction.  To do this new
rim installation I taped the new rim to the old and moved the same old
spokes over from old rim to new one by one.  I tuned the newly rimmed
wheel on the bike by eye and finger flicking spoke tension method.  All
is well and I like my new rim and spoking job.
<BR>
Now that our Brompton enterprise is growing or shall we say maturing a
bit, let me add that our company now carries plenty of replacement
spokes.  From comments lately there may be a run on them!
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Willi Mindak, Sep 98:</EM><BR>
I went through  10 spokes on the rear wheel during the first year of ownership.
During that time the bike has done approx. 1500 miles.
Now I'm a tad on the heavy side, but I still find that excessive.
I take out the rear wheel more often to replace a spoke than to repair a puncture.
It has come to a point where all the remaining spoke nipples are more or less
rounded off from adjusting the tension, even though I use the correct tool.
<BR>
While talking about it at a bikeshop they offered to rebild the rear wheel,
using a kind of brass washer between the rim and the spoke nipple.
Has anybody experience with this type of repair? And how is it supposed to work?
<BR>
My Brompton is little over a year old ( with alloy rims).
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Clive Page, Sep 1998:</EM><BR>
I've found exactly the same thing - I replace a spoke every few weeks, and
now buy them in batches of a dozen or two (from the only cycle shop out of
dozens which stocks the right length).
<BR>
I was told (by Andrew Ritchie actually) that newer Bromptons use stronger
spokes, but these are thicker and won't fit the steel-chromed rims that I
have (and modern Bromptons have alloy rims, which have their own problems,
I gather, so I'm not too anxious to change).  So it's darned annoying.  By
trying very hard to tension all the spokes exactly equally, I can
sometimes induce a gap of around 2 months before another spoke goes.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Phil Gough, Sep 1998:</EM><BR>
My 1988 T5 had exactly this problem, and I am only a puny
130lb rider.  The flanges were too sharp for the spoke
material on the bend. The solution was to havenew alloy
wheels, built up with 2BA brass washers under each
spoke head, and 13guage spokes.  The front wheel was built
radially, and I havn't had a spoke loose let alone break in
3 years.  Incidentally, the spole holes in the Sturmey
Archer hub flange were worn oval by riding with a slack
wheel, and this necessitated a new hubshell, not that easy
to find as the old S5/2 hubs are now obsolete.

<LI><EM CLASS="from">Phil Gough:</EM><BR>
You don't say whether your machine had steel rims, my 1988 T5
did, they were standard then.  The front wheel spokes kept breaking
one after another at the bend.  I replaced them with 13g spokes, but
the best thing I did was to have a new wheel built up on to a Union
juvenile hub (Brompton hubs are narrower than standard), using 13g
tandem spokes and brass washers under the heads and alloy Alisa rims.
Perfect, not a millimetre off true in over 2 years
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Stein Somers, Sep 1997:</EM><BR>
I broke 5 of them in as many months and none at the front.  Some months
ago I tightened them according to John S. Allen's musical method
(<A HREF="http://web0.tiac.net/users/jsallen/bicycle/index.htm">http://web0.tiac.net/users/jsallen/bicycle/index.htm</A>)
and they all seem pleased.  Maybe the lazy ones had already quit.
I ruined and replaced several nipples doing this.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">David Henshaw, Mar 98:</EM><BR>
Ignoring VERY early Bromptons; early machines had slender 14g spokes
front and rear, but these were later changed to chunkier 13g spokes at
the rear, following some failures. This happened in about 1991, so I
suppose your machine could be either type, but from the problems you've
had, it sounds as though you have 14g spokes and steel rims.
I can see no reason why 13g spokes should not fit the steel rims, but
they might need some gentle drilling here or there. A better bet is to
change to the later aluminium rims, use 13g spokes, tension them well,
and fit good aftermarket brake blocks... both the rims and the spokes
should last well. Unless you're heavy and/or equipped with bulging
thighs, that is. But even Dave H doesn't break that many spokes... only
frames.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">David Edge, Sep 1998:</EM><BR>
Yes; similar to the advice of Alf Scrote in A2B, get it tightened up
properly. I did it myself. The factory wheels, as with most similar bikes
are way too loose for us portlies, they need at very least another full
turn. If you're not into wheelbuilding, let the shop do it. If your nipples
are rounding (oo-err missus) throw away the lot and start again though. I
don't know about the brass washers, at 2p each you can hardly go wrong. A
stainless steel rear spoke kit is also available. Finally remember that the
wheel not quite centred as you'd expect - I set mine half way between
locknuts, not flanges - can someone more erudite help me out on this?
<BR>
Eric the Brompton is three years old and has alloy rims. The proof of the
pudding (drool) is in the eating - the only spoke I have broken since (2
years now) was when a rock went through the frong wheel when I was
downhilling off road.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">David Henshaw - A to B, Sep 98:</EM><BR>
Brompton have suffered a few problems with rear spoke failure over the
years, and that's why they now use 13g spokes on the rear. The problem
appears to be caused by the sharp edges on the Sturmey Archer hub flange
holes, which cut through the spokes - the little brass washers help to
prevent this.
If you are a largish person cycling a fair mileage, it's worth keeping
the spokes well tensioned. This helps prevent the spokes squirming around
against the hub flange. Another option that we've found very effective is
to fit an old aluminium S.A. hub casing. The soft alloy will not damage
the spokes.
If you own an older bike with 14g spokes, upgrade to the newer ones or
sell the bike to someone lighter and buy a new one.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Clive Page, Sep 1998:</EM><BR>
[...] the broken spokes are, I think, no so much because of terrible
roads, but because I tend to pull away from rest rather fast.  I've now
trained myself to pull away from traffic lights in 2nd gear not 1st (I
have a 5-speed gear), and this helps.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Custfold, Sep 1998:</EM><BR>
Examine any old or cheap hub when it is dismantled for a wheel rebuild and you
will see oval spoke holes and grooves worn by spokes, hence the use of small
washers, the coutersinking of the 'bend side' of flange holes to stop damage
to the inside of the spoke bends, and an option to lace all the spokes inside
the flange, and other individual solutions.
<BR>
Keep spoke tension as a regular check, and also the wobbles of the rim which
give early clues of trouble in store.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Phil Gough, Oct 1998:</EM><BR>
Smaller wheels store less stretch than bigger ones, which means IMHO that they have to be
tensioned more and this puts a bigger stress on the spoke bend and hub holes.
Initially you have a stronger wheel, but when something starts to give under the high tension
then the spokes go slack one after the other, eventually breaking at the bend.
The slack spokes ovalise the holes in the hub flange and after a while the hub is a write-off too!
That's why brass washers under the spoke heads are a good idea.
Especially for steel hub flanges which are thinner than alloy and
give less support to the spoke head.
<BR>
This could be rubbish I'm not an expert but both of the original steel rimmed wheels
on the Brompton (1988 model) suffered an endless succession of loose and broken spokes
to the extent that I used to carry a spoke key and a small bundle of spokes around all the time.
Finally cured by the brass washers and 13G spokes.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Channell Wasson, Jun 1999:</EM><BR>
Recommend you replace any broken spoke ASAP.  And while you are at it tune
up front and back wheels with spoke wrench (14 gauge green wrench for front wheel, 13 gauge red
for rear). If you don't know how to do this watch your bike mechanic do it
and you will soon learn (in most cases). If you can not find a spoke of
correct lenght, just cut any normal spoke to approximate Brompton length
and then bend a hook in it at the hub end and install the spoke. Parameters
of bike repair are not always as critical as we might think. "Just do it"
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Custfold, Jun 1999:</EM><BR>
I break spokes, and have a WIGATI with the 7 speed hub which I took out of
service when over 30% of spokes had failed, generally you can endure a
careful and wobbly ride home on a 28 hole wheel with 7 broken spokes, as we
did one day with a Moulton AM7 - from Aberfoyle to Glasgow, but it is useful
to have a spoke key or good set of pliers handy to correct the pull from the
remaining spokes.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Channell Wasson, Jun 1999:</EM><BR>
I've never seen a broken spoke in a Brompton front wheel. But it
occasionally happens in the rear, always at the bend at the hub and usually
always on the driving sprocket side. The front wheel is exceptionally strong
and ridgid due to radial spoking. The rear wheel has "two cross lacing", and
thus spokes have a chance to work a bit in the hub sockets as one pedals the
bike.  Some times a user will install radial spoking on the non driving side
of rear wheel which tends to provide more rigidity to the rear power wheel.
Keeping spokes tight and wheels "tuned" and clean helps too in avoiding
broken spokes. The Brompton with 28 spokes in each wheel is engineered for
rigorous daily use.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Len Rubin, Jun 1999:</EM><BR>
I have always used 16 spokes (has to be divisible by four for a "normal"
rear hub (drive, non-drive, pulling, non-pulling). Also, although we are dear friends, and at the (small) risk of
offending, I would disagree with my esteemed colleague regarding much of his
lay analysis of wheelbuilding "theory"; for a better understanding, I highly
recommend Jobst Brandt's classic text on the subject.
<BR>
The age old problem of spokes breaking at the elbow in wheels using thin
steel hub flanges (e.g. Sturmey Archer's rear hubs) has very little to do
with cross patterns. It is the result of unrelieved stress due to the thin
and hard steel flange (hence the rarity of spoke breakage on similar,
properly built wheels using thicker, softer alloy hub flanges.)
<BR>
The classic treatment is to rebuild with high quality, 14-gauge stainless
steel spokes, adding a couple of tiny brass washers under each spoke head,
to relieve the stress on the unsupported elbow, by snugging it up against
the flange. This helps, as does proper spoke tension.
<BR>
In a properly built very small wheel the tensioned structure is much more
nearly static, rather than highly dynamic, and as such, cross patterns and
other variables don't have a large effect. Insufficient, excessive or uneven
tension and trauma/damage are the main variables affecting spoke breakage
due to fatigue or notch failure.
<BR>
Wheelbuilding is a fine art and science, despite the enormous amount of
myths, anecdotes, convictions and opinions that are offered up as
"knowledge".
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Willi Mindak, Jun 99:</EM><BR>
Yes,  it works. I can only offer anecdotal evidence, but after replacing more than a dozen spokes
the rear rim finally split and the wheel had to be rebuild.
It was done with the brass washers Len mentions, and since then I didn't have to replace a single spoke in about 800 miles.
I'm convinced that my weight (104 Kg naked with glasses) is _the_ deciding factor in these breakages.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">VELODROOM -- urban mobility concepts, Jul 2000:</EM><BR>
One little tip for the slightly heavier Bromtponist: Should you still
experience problems due to spoke stress even after tightening the original
wheel, have your rear wheel rebuilt with butted (2.34-2.00mm) stainless
Sapim Strong spokes crossed only once (because of the better spoke angle at
the rim entry).
These spokes are not available in the right length, but can be cut to size
with... Yes, the above mentioned machine (We use a Hozan, cheap and cheerful
and really essential for any Brompton dealer).
We did such a wheel for our heaviest customer (roughly 260lbs) and there
haven't been any problems in over a year of harsh daily abuse.
Also make sure to have washers (M2.5) put under the spoke heads to emulate a
thicker hub flange.

<H3><A NAME="191"></A>Rim design: is the spoke angle wrong?</H3>
<UL>
<LI><EM CLASS="from">willimindak, Sep 97:</EM><BR>
[...] the rims seem to be drilled for
radial spokes (which is o.k. for the front wheel), but the rear wheel
uses a crossover pattern, so the spokes enter the rim at an angle. This
[wrong drilling pattern]
makes them prone to become loose and they tend to break. I've read the
handbook and had the spokes re- tigthened after initial use, but had a
breakage nevertheless. The spoke nipples protrude too far into the tube
space, and the rim- tape is fairly thick to prevent damage to the tube.
This may lead to a problem when tyres with higher pressure are used.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Willi Mindak, Oct 98:</EM><BR>
While having a close look at the wheel I couldn't help noticing that the spokes
are not really straight. They are slightly bend just before they enter the rim,
where the nipple grips them. That's because the rim has a 'radial' bore.
The nipple therfore can only take spokes that enter the rim radial (give or take
the odd degree or two).
The spokes with their crossover pattern enter the rim under a greater angle than
the nipple can accomodate.
This results in a slightly bend spoke, no matter how tight you scrw the nipple on.
<BR>
I don't know whether I make myself terribly clear; it is difficult to describe
without a drawing. But check with your bikes.
<BR>
I believe this is a problem, because surely spokes can only take forces in a straight line.
Can the spoke breakages that myself and others experience be caused by that
(apart from our weight)?
The front wheel is not a problem, because here the spokes run radial.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Custfold, Sep 1998:</EM><BR>
The ideal angle for the spoke to meet the rim is I understand less than 5
degrees, to minimise the side thrust at the nipple end and reactive forces at
the flange.  The Brompton and other SWB cannot easily achieve this unless the
nipple seats are profiled to suit.

<H2><A NAME="cracked_rim"></A>Rims worn out</H2>
As on many bikes, the Brompton's rims not only make up a wheel structure.
They also offer a surface on which the brake blocks operate.
<P>
Some have complained about the rapid wear of their Brompton's rims,
and potential accidents when the wheel suddenly "explodes" under the tyre's pressure.
<P>

<LI><EM CLASS="from">Stein Somers:</EM><BR>
[...] I was alarmed by an unusual sound: the rear rim bumped into a break pad
due to a 1cm crack on the side of the rim! [...]
At some 10km from home, the rim gave up on me
and I had to walk.  The crack had grown to 15cm and couldn't resist
the tire's push anymore.
Now for the facts: after 2700km of what I would call "normal road use"
during 6 months, the sides of the rear rim have been polished away
by the brake pads. Only recently I read this problem exists.
I felt long before, while trueing the wheel, that the rim sides seemed
curbed, but I thought this was just the way they were made.
Some of you wrote how they spent thousands and thousands of miles on their
Brompton, without a serious problem.  So why does this happen to me?
<P>
It was probably due to a lack of maintenance on the original
brake blocks (<A CLASS="quick" HREF="Brakes.html#brake_blocks">Spotlight on brakes - Brake blocks</A>), and bad braking style.
Lesson learnt: minimize brake block contact by braking hard,
intermittendly and preferably on the front wheel.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Peter Hubbard, Jun 1998:</EM><BR>
[...] I purchased a Brompton L3 last Monday.
By Thursday I could hear the brake blocks grinding the rims and the
rims are already well scratched. The blocks are marked 'for alloy'. I
cleaned the surfaces of the blocks still on the bike using a thin nylon
'pan scourer' backed by a piece of thin cardboard to protect the rims.
<BR>
This seems to have removed the grit (or whatever) and braking is now
all quiet. Is this standard for alloy rims? It seems I'm going to have
to do this every day or wear out the rims in no time.
<BR>
Not a problem, it just adds to the fun, right?
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Willi Mindak, Sep 98:</EM><BR>
Yesterday the rear rim failed on my Brompton after 14 month and approx. 2000 miles.
Trouble is: nothing spectacular happened that could have caused the failure.
I was riding through Richmond park, and became aware of the failure when I applied
the rear brake.
A couple of hundred yards before I had used the brake and not noticed a thing.
Apart from me feeling nothing: there were no marks of an impact on the rim.
The wear on the outer surface of the rim due to brake action is negligible
(hardly noticable, and not half as bad as on the front wheel).
<BR>
The side of the rim is split on approx. 10 cm in length and bend outwards.
It follows the part of the rim where the bead of the tyre presses against.
The tyre had 80 psi pressure.
<BR>
Now I was going to have the wheel rebuild anyway, because I seem to be the world
record holder for broken spokes.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Andras Toth, Feb 1999:</EM><BR>
After riding my Brompton with a broken spoke in the back wheel for about a
month, the side of the rim split on a lenght of about 10 cms.

I gotta admit that I am completely dumb when it comes to bicycle reparation
so I took it to a bicycle repair shop near me where they told me they could
not do anything with it, the entire wheel has to be changed.
Is this complete rubbish, or do you too think it is hopeless?
<UL>
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Alasdair Baxter, Feb 1999:</EM><BR>
I don't think there is any connection between the broken spoke and the split
rim.  The fact that the rim split is just one of these things probably down
to a defect in the metal or in manufacture.  You may have pumped up the tyre
too hard, of course.
<BR>
There is no cheap way of fixing this, I'm afraid.  Welding aluminium alloy
is a highly specialised procedure and is likely to cost as much as a new
wheel from London if not more.  If your university has an engineering
department, they might be prepared to help as a type of educational project
but I doubt it.
<BR>
A rim is not a heavy item and if you contact Brompton Bicycle in London and
tell them of your problem, they may well send you a new one out and you
could be pleasantly surprised at the low price including freight.  If, as
you imply, the bike is not very old, they could well send you a new rim for
free.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">David Edge, Feb 1999:</EM><BR>
Humbly beg to disagree. A broken spoke will cause the rim to bulge and thus
increase force and wear from brake block. Of course, the rim may well have
been close to the edge, and the little extra wear there pushed it over sooner.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Custfold, Feb 1999:</EM><BR>
The 2 occurrences are only related by a slight chance that the weakened rim
stressed the spoke sufficiently to break it, before the rim itself gave way.
<BR>
My back wheel currently has 3 broken spokes (of 36) and this is less than it
had before I rebuilt it.
<BR>
Basic wheelbuilding is not a mystic art - ask Andy Follis who received a rim
and 28+ spokes from me with a little encouragement, and went on to rebuild his
rear wheel over a couple of days.  With practice you can usually lace up or
respoke and roughly true a wheel on a typical 1 hour train trip as I
frequently did when commuting between Edinburgh & Glasgow, occasionally driven
by the fact that I needed the wheel back on the bike to ride away at the other
end.

Add me to the failed rims list. 9 miles from home, 10:30 at night,
funny feeling to the back wheel--a sort of rhythmical bump. Stop and
check by a poor street light. Nothing obvious. Brakes apparently
aligned as far as I could see. Get back on--same problem. Oh, well,
hope it's nothing serious and Arnold will get me home. Half a mile
later it's getting worse, but I still can't see what's wrong. Another
hundred yards and whatever it is won't let the back wheel turn. By the
light of my (detached) headlight it is now obvious, as several inches
of the rim are sticking out. And that's at about 1800 miles with the
occasional checking/cleaning of brakeblocks and I think about half
a dozen tire changes.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Roland Elsenberg, Jan 2000:</EM><BR>
Last week my rear rim failed. This time it lasted for about 10,000 km.
This was achieved with KoolStops and is about twice as much as
with the standard brake blocks. I carried the hub to my Brompton
Dealer, riding on my old Brompton. On my way back the front rim
failed on that. I admit to put more than the allowed 100psi into my
Schwalbe tires.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Jeff Dauvin, Jan 2000:</EM><BR>
I have had my Brompton since last May & have done about 2000 miles. I
weigh about 86kg. Am I compatible with Brompton use?
<BR>
I had to change to soft (Fibrax) front brake
blocks as the bike was virtually unstoppable on hills. I tried
to run a couple of chains because mine gets very dirty but
already the rear sprocket is too worn to the current one to have
another one clean all the time. Today the rear rim joint failed on
one side (splaying out) & the tyre was pushing a split into the
braking surface of the rim at about 1cm per 10 minutes when my wife

Some people get through a lot of rims, while others barely scratch the
surface. Aztec blocks [<A CLASS="quick" HREF="Brakes.html#AltBrakeBlocks">Spotlight on brakes - Alternative brake blocks</A>] help quite a bit, but there's no cure other than to
clean the blocks and rims at frequent intervals. 1997 bikes have anodized
rims that can wear out particularly quickly thanks to the anodizing
becoming embedded in the blocks. The very latest rims are unfinished
alloy, and hence a little better.

<LI><EM CLASS="from">Hanel, Steven D., Apr 1998:</EM><BR>
Annodizing usually makes a rim last longer unless you are using the
original Brompton brake blocks. Hint: change the blocks. An un-annodized
rim is actually softer and much more prone to wear and oxidation. The
annodizing is a process where a coating to protect the aluminum is
electro-chemically bonded to it. Personally I wouldn't ride a bike with
the cheaper, softer, un-annodized finish.
</UL>
<LI><EM CLASS="from">David Henshaw, May 98:</EM><BR>
There have been a few problems with the 1997 Bromptons. It appears that
the rim manufacturers forced Brompton to adopt anodised rims and in a few
cases these have reacted badly with the brake blocks causing quite rapid
failure. A very good answer is to fit larger, softer after-market blocks
such as the excellent Aztec... these cause much lower rim wear.
Not all bikes are effected, but failure can be quite rapid on those that
are.
<OL>
<LI>Pre-anodised rims are polished. Unfortunately anodised and
post-anodised rims are of very similar appearance. The new rims are plain
milled alloy - sort of mat grey finish. They should be fine.
<LI>The post-anodised rims were not fitted to bikes until January/February
this year, so there's no certainty that you were sold 'old stock'.

Interestingly, I was talking with a fellow L3 owner on the train this morning,
and mentioned the
brake rim wear problem I had had with mine, and he had the original shoes, but
he didn't seem to have any roughness or scoring on the rims - he said he had
had his L3 for about 5 months.  I wonder if the problem is avoided if the
dealer / owner / brompton clean up the rims when they
are new.  I think a lot of the initial crud in the shoes came from the welds in
the rims - if this had
been sanded smooth in the first place, would it have ruined the shoes & rims?
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Meryl Prestidge:</EM><BR>
I have heard of this happening on a Dawes Galaxy, as the anodizing
wears off the rim and becomes embedded in the brake blocks, making them
abrasive.  The advice is (a) check the blocks regularly and dig out any
bits of metal, and (b) change the blocks after about 500 miles on a new
anodized rim.  That includes silver anodizing, BTW.  You did change the
blocks, but maybe most of the damage was already done?

Fibrax leather blocks (great for steel rims) can wear away alloy, and

I've just bought a T3 and have experienced alot of wheel rim wear - but
mostly this  has been due to grit embedding itself in the block and carving
the rims!  I'm getting quick at taking blocks off to clear them.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Channell Wasson, Mar 1998:</EM><BR>
[...] I talked at length to a major
brake block manufacturer's agent about advantages in using longer brake
blocks.  His bottom line response was that efficient braking can be
obtained from something the size of a pencil eraser, but the bike riding
public likes the long brake pads so we make them! I think Brompton is on
the right track with the brake pads that are currently being used. I'm
not a rocket scientist so I will let others comment on this.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Cartmell Anthony, May 1998:</EM><BR>
This discussion reminds me of my engineering training, where we learnt
about grinding wheels.  To grind a relatively soft metal like aluminium
you should use a harder grinding wheel abrasive.  To grind harder metals
like tempered steel you should use a softer grinding wheel abrasive.  So
I would guess to minimise the wear on rims you should use soft brake
blocks on soft rims (plain aluminium) and hard brake blocks on hard rims
(anodized, ceramic, and steel).  Harder brake blocks will also wear less
as road grit will be less likely to get embedded in the block, and even
if it does it won't change the block's characteristics so much.
<BR>
I guess the problem with anodised rims is caused by soft brake blocks
being used.  These pick up road grit and grind away at the harder rim
surface nicely.  No amount of cleaning will prevent this happening, only
cycling on perfectly grit-free roads...
<BR>
If you have steel rims, get hold of the leather-faced Raleigh Rain-check
blocks.  They work well in the dry and excellently in the wet.  The
blocks will last thousands of miles too.

The Pantour hub offers suspension - bit of a pig to build as it has a thick flange.
Not supplied with 80mm skewer in 80mm size, just like SON,
so you have to change the capscrew on a 100mm SON skewer.
A cut-down 100mm x M5 SON bolt with the end 'nuts' will work -
not q/r but 5mm socket key, and does not work properly with B latch for front forks

Did anyone else have to modify his/her fork dropouts, too? Mine were only suitable for 8mm axles

Making your own skewer isn't a problem provided you find a standard one that's thick enough
(with a cut thread, not a rolled-on one) and have a 5mm thread cutter.

A terrifying cracking suddenly sounded from the front fork.

making the noise.  I never loosened the front wheel let alone the hub.

The ball-bearings of my Bromptons front hub sound worn. The outer parts are
o.k. The inner parts (are they called cones?) are worn. As the axles of
common hubs are not only longer but also thicker, it seems to be difficult
to get spare parts for the Bromptons front hub.
All my dealer can find for replacement is the entire hub.
Is it possible to get parts of it in the U.K.? Is the manufacturer known?

My front hub is giving me problems too.  After about 8
months it was in dire need of an overhaul.  The
mechanic said it had already taken a lot of abuse and
would probably need to be replaced soon (he also said
it had a cartridge used in cheaper hubs to save on the
number of bearings needed).  Three months later I'm
starting to see the signs of bearing problems.  I have
the original front hub.  What options are there for
replacement that will last longer than the Brompton
factory hub?
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Robert Payne, Mar 2000:</EM><BR>

5000 km seem to be possible. The cones are not easy to obtain
here in Germany. I try to rotate the axle so that the worn parts
of the cones face upwards.
About one year ago someone on this list suggested to buy a new
wheel instead of replacing the hub. Replacing the front wheel
is cheaper than a new hub and the work to built a wheel with it,
at least here in Germany.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">David Cox, Mar 2000:</EM><BR>
I bought my L3 in 1994 and have no recollection of doing any maintenance on
the front hub beyond the odd squirt of oil.  It is an earlier design than
the current ones and looks very basic. It may be that Gascoigne Cycles who
looked it over 2 years ago made some adjustments but there was no charge for
new parts.
<BR>
I've not kept a record of mileage and am on my third computer which is
playing up ) but I do 5000 per year and a fair bit of that (say 25%) has
been on the Brompton including two years of regular commuting all weathers
18 miles a working day.  I guess it is well up to 5000 miles probably more.
<BR>
The Brompton has also been taken abroad by plane in a softbag and a case and
ridden down rough tracks.  It really has been a robust and jolly companion
needing more cleaning but probably less fundamental maintenance than my
other bikes.

adjustment.

My cones went bad after 1200 mi.  was told the hub was "cheap" (a whole new

<LI><EM CLASS="from">Peter O'Reilly, Jun 2000:</EM><BR>
This past winter I re-greased my front hub.  While riding the B the front
wheel totally locked up!  This was after a couple of rides subsequent to the
hub work.  I am not completely sure why it happened - maybe a combination of
the front bolts and cups/cones being too loose.
I guess there was some movement going on with the lockrings/cones against
the fork.
<BR>
Afterwards I then reassembled the front wheel - trying to get the cones set
just right as much as possible.  I erred on the conservative side - meaning
having the cones set a tad bit too loose, than too tight before placing the
wheel back on the fork.  After placing the wheel on the fork, there was only
the slightest detection of play.  I also made sure the outer bolts clamped
the wheel and the inner lockrings were real tight to the fork.
<BR>
Months later and probably a couple hundred miles more on the B - the front
hub has become loose.  Enough so to detect it while riding the B.
I never experienced such a problem with my other bikes (all which use quick
release skewers - possible hint?).
<BR>
When I re-greased my hub, it was after about
a year of use.  There was a modest amount of grease left.  The cartridge
bearings looked like they were in good shape and no pitting had occurred.
Interestingly enough, I have had the B for about 1.5 years now.
<BR>
It has been my observation that wheels that leave the factory do not come
with well greased bearings.  Yes, I may be over generalizing, but I
speculate such happens more often than not.  I base my comments on
experiences with the B, my other bike with expensive hubs and others I have
talked too.

Do most of your braking on the front wheel and replace it regularly

<LI><EM CLASS="from">Peter O'Reilly, Mar 2000:</EM><BR>
I just regreased the bearings in the front hub recently.  It's a fairly
simple process; easier than removing and reassebling the rear wheel (w/ gear
adjustment) in my experience.  With that in mind I will be more inclined to
check the fron hub after riding in wet weather.  I estimate that I have
about 1,200 miles on the bike and the front wheel (rim and hub) are in fine
shape.  Using KoolStop brake pads and keeping the rim surface reasonably
clean, I suspect the front wheel may last a long time.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Peter O'Reilly, Mar 2000:</EM><BR>
You need to tighten the cones.  Tighten them completely on the axel and then
turn them a 1/4 turn or so loose. Spin the wheel with your hands, if it
wobbles, repeat the previous step with an 1/8th of a turn.  If it is too
tight, you hear/feel a grinding noise or the wheel does not spin, turn the
cones more than a 1/4 turn after initially tightening them.  err on the side
of too loose as when you reattach the wheel more pressure will be placed on
the cones.   Adjusting the cones/hub takes some trial and error.
Afterwards, retighten the the outer nuts (ones immediately adjacent to the
cones) and while doing so make sure the cones remain stationary as you
tighten the hub (requires a pair of flat wrenches to do).  Hope this helps.

What rims (make/model/hole drilling) comes standard on the Brompton? I'd
like to know what people think about replacing the stock box section rims
with Sun M14A aero section rims. The M14As are probably lighter, stronger,
and more aerodynamic but don't look like they would support the wide 37mm
tyre as well and could make the handling more difficult in terms of trying
to control the bike if it had a front blowout.
<BR>
Also has anyone put Moulton 32-369mm tyres/rims on a Brompton? If so how
did it work out?
<P>{Leonard Rubin}
What's all this foolishness? The Brompton uses 16" (ETRTO 349) tires,
Moultons use 17" (ETRTO 369), Fridays use two 20" standards (ETRTO 406 and
ETRTO 451), depending on the model. The original equipment rim on the
Brompton is an Alesa "Alloy 219" with an outer width of 25mm.
<BR>
Zach knows (or should--he's seen the bike enough times:-)) that I have had
made and use exclusively Sun M14A aero section rims on my Brompton (dubbed
by others here the "Super Brompton"), and have found them quite suitable. I
use the Primo tires and special 1" superlight inner tubes (that I initially
bought from Zach!). I have had no punctures, nor other undesirable side
effects, and have realized a very substantial weight reduction and improved
ride. As far as providing adequate support for wide tires, this is a
legitimate concern, but the combination of the Primo tires and the Sun M14A
section seems to work quite well, as long as you take care in mounting and
inflating the tires, as is standard necessity with narrow rim/wide tire

Primo is coming out with a 37-305 tyre. This is nominally a 16x1.5 in the
archaic terminology. It will have the same casing as the 37-349 people have
been using on Bromptons and recumbents. The advantage of this smaller
diameter rim size is even less weight (less material in tyre, rim, and
spokes) and a more compact size for a potentially smaller folded package.
Also for certain configurations of recumbents there will be more crank
clearance. The disadvantage will most likely be worse rough road
performance as the smaller diameter tyre tends to slow down more on bumps
and go deeper into potholes. For those switching to the 305mm wheel size it
is good to know this size is used on most 16" children's bikes so cheap
emergency replacements are readily available. Schwalbe also makes a 54-305
