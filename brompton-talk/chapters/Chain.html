<H2><A NAME="ChainStretch"></A>When to replace the chain?</H2>
<EM CLASS="from">Willi Mindak, Apr 99:</EM><BR>
When is it time to replace the chain?
Is the damage to sprockets/ chainwheel a result of a worn (lengthened?) chain,
or is the chain worn because of wear to sprockets and chainwheel?
Should one replace the chain more frequently, or is it best to replace the whole drivetrain at the same time?
<UL>
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Andrew Henry, Apr 1999:</EM><BR>
The order that these wear out is first the chain, then the
sprocket, and then the chain ring.
<BR>
You should change the chain when it has lengthened by 1%.
The easiest way to measure this is to measure 24 links of
the chain.  When the chain is new, this should measure
12.00 inches.  You should change the chain when 24 links
are longer than 12.125 inches (12 1/8th inches).  If you
only have a metric ruler, the 24 links should normally
measure 304.8mm and you should change it when they measure
307.8mm.
<BR>
You can buy expensive tools that claim to measure chain wear,
but they are less accurate and more fiddly to use than using
a ruler !
<BR>
If you change your chain soon enough, then the new chain
should work fine with the old sprocket and chainwheel.
If the new chain skips on the old sprocket, it is too
worn.  You then have to decide whether to put the old
chain back on and accept that the old chain will wear
out the chain ring out as well, or just replace the sprocket.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Geoff Law, Apr 1999:</EM><BR>
I use a new chain as a chain measuring tool. Just put the new and old chain
side by side.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">David Edge, Apr 1999:</EM><BR>
By the time my chain had lengthened by 1/8" in 10", ie 1.2% the sprocket
was hooked and there was very pronounced wear in the chainwheel. I'd
probably have needed a new chainset if I hadn't snapped the crank shortly
afterwards. However, the chain that came new with my Brompton was peculiar
insofaras there were big gaps between the rollers and sideplates.
<BR>
So, yes. I'd say change at approaching 1% wear on the chain. Then when you
fit a new chain, reverse the sprocket.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Stein Somers, Apr 1999:</EM><BR>
Visit <A HREF="http://www.sheldonbrown.com/chains.html">http://www.sheldonbrown.com/chains.html</A> (a site so great it could only be
improved upon would Sheldon Brown come over to your place and explain matters).
<BR>
In short, he advises to change at 0.5% of stretch (1/16"/12").  At 1%,
the sprocket will be badly worn, which is also my experience.
<BR>
A key feature of the Brompton compared to the average bicycle is that
there is only one sprocket, and a small one too.
That means it wears quickly, but on the other hand there is little to replace.
So ecology-wise it would be best to grind away the
chain and sprocket until the chainring starts suffering too, which is
probably well over 1%.
<BR>
However, depending on your situation, the Brompton sprocket may not be easy to obtain and may
cost as much as a chain, and replacing is not as easy as replacing the chain.
So last time I changed the chain at 0.5%.  The sprocket still
sounded ill at ease with the new chain but they became friends quickly.
<BR>
The first time I replaced the chain, was because the sprocket was very
badly worn, even though I had checked chain stretch often (read: a few
times). It turned out the chain very unevenly stretched, 0.5% to 2.5%
depending on where you measure.  The chain - as fitted by Brompton -
counted 50 links, as much as there are teeth on the chainring, which
left just a few links driving the sprocket at each pedal stroke.
By the way, the wheel with the worn sprocket had just been rebuilt
in my local Brompton shop, go figure.

I think the problem Stein mentioned is a theorethical one.
With my average of about one puncture per month the positon of the chain
relative to the chainwheel is changed frequently and automatically.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Stein Somers, Apr 1999:</EM><BR>
Excellent point. But for me to take out the wheel, a simple puncture or
a single broken spoke is not enough. I still remember changing the wheel
for the first time.  So most likely I never changed the chain's position in the first
2500km.
</UL>
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Willi Mindak, Apr 99:</EM><BR>
At the weekend I decided to have a closer look at the chain, split it and used a new chain as a 'standard'.
The old chain had stetched more than one link, so it was outside the 1% limit, let alone the 0.5% that Sheldon Brown and Stein recommend.
The chain wasn't streched evenly as Stein had predicted.
Some links did not appear to have any stretch at all, while others were quite worn.
The sprocket was ok, but I had changed to a 14 teeth some time ago, so it is fairly new.
The bad news is that the chainwheel is also damaged. Every tooth had a sharp edge worn into it on the inside.
I replaced the chain and used a file to smooth over the chaiwheel surface (I know it's not recommended,
but I hope to get a little bit more life out of chain and chainwheel).
<BR>
The bike is 18 month old and has done approx. 3000 miles.
In the interest of efficiency and economics I would replace the chain at 2000 miles,
and the whole lot (chain, chainwheel and sprocket) at around 4000 miles.
<BR>
If you change to a 14 teeth sprocket, insert one link into the chain.
With the new chain and my 'full' figure in the saddle the chain appeared to be too tight.
With the suspension working it will probably be overstretched and premature damage will occur in the drivetrain.

<LI><EM CLASS="from">Steven M. Scharf, Nov 1998:</EM><BR>
Go to a motorcycle parts store and buy a can of foaming
chain lube. Unlike other spray lubricants, it actually penetrates
into the links. It's nearly as good as removing the chain and
soaking it, and it takes only a few seconds.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">john blackburn, Feb 1999:</EM><BR>
I have for many years used Edwards High Vacuum grease, which is usable
down to 0.0001mm of mercury. It is intended for lubricating O-rings and
other joints in high-vacuum experiments. So it doesn't evaporate (if it
did it would destroy the vacuum) - it stays there for ever. Under-water
grease is also useful for bicycles, but only where a very thick grease
is required.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Jim McLaughlin, Oct 1999:</EM><BR>
I prefer petroleum based lubricants as they can displace moisture better
and thereby prevent rust.  Messy though.

<H3><A NAME="262"></A>White Lightning</H3>
<UL>
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Rob Cope, Nov 1998:</EM><BR>
The bicycle chain is a notorious dirt-gatherer: a particular problem for
folders, which tend to be brought inside more than most bikes.  My search
for a clean, effective chain lube lead me to experiment with White Lightning
& Finish Line Krytox, 2 paraffin wax-based lubes.  Both are promoted as
self-cleaning: the wax enveloping dirt & flaking off.  Sounded ideal.
However, I cannot recommend either as:water resistance seems minimal: even
light rain led to squeaks & a need to fully reapply.  Both lubes are
relatively expensive (UKP6 for a medium bottle); combine this with frequent
reapplication & the need to use them generously & you're looking at a
significant bill. The chain did remain cleaner than with other lubes, but I
think I'd rather have a longer-lasting lube, even if it has to be cleaned
off occasionally.
<BR>
Above is, of course, not under any scientific test conditions.  However, I
note from one lube test  <A HREF="http://home.att.net/~kclunis/index.html">http://home.att.net/~kclunis/index.html</A> that White
Lightning is regarded as a short-interval lube only.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">John Carss, Nov 1998:</EM><BR>
I agree with what you say. I tried White Lightning this summer and was
disappointed that I had to reapply every time the bike got wet, which this
summer was quiet frequently.
<BR>
It does have one major advantage though, when it comes to rear wheel
punctures the whole process is far less messy.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Willi Mindak, Nov 98:</EM><BR>
I bought a bottle of 'White Lightning' chain lube, and am as disappointed as Rob.
It needs frequent re- application in winter conditions.
During the summer it wasn't too bad (one re- application every three weeks),
but I find that when it's wet outside even a 10 mile ride is enough for the squeeks to develop,
and a re-application is called for.
Thanks to that I go fairly quickly through that &pound;6 bottle, and do not intend to buy it again.
It is the cleanest lube I came across, though.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Stein Somers, Nov 1998:</EM><BR>
The topic used to be discussed in much detail in the commute-logistics
mailing list (I'm no longer subscribed) and White Lightning seemed the
White Knight of commuters.  After fiercely searching for a supply I have
been stuck ;^) to it for over a year.
<BR>
I'm not sure I understand why people say it is clean: to me it looks
dirtier than other lubes.  But the dirt is harmless, unlike grease that
permanently settles into clothing and requires industrial soap to get
off your hands.  It needs to be reapplied often and particularly after
rain (although it improved after a while).  I clean the chain with a dry
brush, quick and easy.  Costs?  I'll have to use many bottles to top the
pile of dirty trousers I had to exclude from everyday life.

You may find it easier when re-fitting the chain to remove the tensioner.
IMO that's easier than trying to thread the chain through the tensioner.

<LI>Is the chain lubricated?  Check for stiff links.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Phil Gough, Jul 1999:</EM><BR>
I have known mud and crud buildup on and around the sprocket to lift the chain up off the teeth of the sprocket.  But you have to really neglect  cleaning the bike to get it this bad.
<LI>Chain is strechted or simply too long for the current chainring and sprocket.
When the Brompton is unfolded, the chain tensioner arm shoud be almost horizontal, slightly downwards.
Replace the chain if it is stretched 1% (unless you have your own chain replacement policy).
Check if you could remove a link from the chain while the bike is unfolded (the maximum chain length required is when you start folding the rear wheel assembly).
<LI>Can the chain tensioner (the arm with idler pulley) rotate freely, apart from the spring force?
<UL>
<LI><EM CLASS="from">David Henshaw, Oct 98:</EM><BR>
Pull [the tensioner arm] back and release it.
If it doesn't return smartly, it either has a seized
bush or has been incorrectly assembled. Both easily cured, and both will
cause the chain to mysteriously drop off when folding.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">David Edge, Oct 1998:</EM><BR>
Chain tensioner bearing tight or seized? The bearing is like the one in a
deraileur jockey - the metal tube shouldn't rotate, but the plastic should
slide
around it.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">David Cox, Jun 1999:</EM><BR>
I had this trouble with a relatively new chain and solved it by replacing
the chain tensioner. This was on a much used 4 year old L3. I'd bought a
spare tensioner some time before because it just looked vulnerable to wear
and tear.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">James Hudson, Nov 1999:</EM><BR>
It's not elegant, but a real fast fix is to loosen the tensioner screw (the
tensioner tensioner) by half a turn.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Nico J. de Boer, Nov 1999:</EM><BR>
More elegant would be to clean the tensioner inside: mine got very rusty
last winter. The metal tube around which the plastic arm pivots, that is.
You'll have to take it off, but unless you have two left hands it is not
that hard.

BUT: when your chainline is not absolutely straight, the chain comes off
as well. I noticed this after a Shimano 105 crank (with 42 teeth
chainring) was mounted. The chainline was not straight at all, and the
chain kept coming off, until I mounted the chainring on the inside, (it
was on the outside, in the "52 teeth position"), thereby obtaining a
straight chainline and no more chain problems.
</UL>

I've replaced the standard 13 tooth sprocket with a 14 tooth (see <A CLASS="quick" HREF="Sprocket.html#sprocket">Spotlight on the rear sprocket - Replacement rear sprockets</A>).
Now the idler wheel is so close that it seems the chain cannot jump off there at all
(but someone claimed it did).
I couldn't notice the slightly reduced gearing, which really was too high anyway.
<LI><EM CLASS="from">David Edge, Oct 1998:</EM><BR>
If all else fails you can buy 'half' links to tweak the tension.

After
dirtying my hands numerous times, I decided to let Channell, the USA
distributor, see what he could do.  Though he could see nothing amiss, he
replaced the chain and chain tensioner and I haven't had the problem since.
Channell charged nothing!

I ran into the same problem down here in DC a few

<LI><EM CLASS="from">Roland Elsenberg, Feb 2000:</EM><BR>
Probably the front wheel throws snow upon the chain. The
snow gets stuck between the cog and the hub and lifts the chain off the cog.
I once managed to break the part of the chain tensioner that holds the fixed
idler.
Try riding in 1st gear. Over a given distance the cog makes more revolutions
than in other gears. This
helps to clean the narrow space between cog and hub. A cog with 14 teeth
gives more clearance. A larger front flap may also help.

<H2><A NAME="266"></A>Narrowing down to 1/2 x 3/32 chains?</H2>
<UL>
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Andrew Brooks:</EM><BR>
both local bike shops [...] could only find bits of 1/2 x 3/32 inch chain.
What's more, both shops only stocked this size even if I wanted to buy
a whole new chain. [...]
Obviously I can't mix the narrower stuff with the 1/2 x 1/8 inch chain
on the Brompton, but is it alright to replace the whole chain with
the smaller size?
<LI><EM CLASS="from">Andrew Henry:</EM><BR>
Links on bicycle chains are all 0.5 inches long nowadays.
Shimano made some based on a 10mm pitch 10-20 years ago.
There are also some other sizes which were last made a
lot earlier than that.  1/8th inch wide chains are still
being made.  Good bike shops should definitely know of
them even if they don't keep them in stock.  You should
certainly be able to get them from anywhere which sells
bikes with hub gears.
<BR>
1/2 x 3/32 inch chain is more flexible from side to side than
1/2 x 1/8 inch chain.  This is an advantage if you want to
change between different ratios with a derailleur.  With hub
gears, this would make the chain fall off more easily.
<BR>
Sheldon Brown's article on fixed gear bikes
(<A HREF="http://www.sheldonbrown.com/biz/hub/fixeda.html">http://www.sheldonbrown.com/biz/hub/fixeda.html</A>) says that the
modern bushingless narrow chains are more reliable than 1/8th
inch chains.  However, Francis Thurmer - an "itinerant bicycle
repairman" - disagrees with this.  He sells Sedis 1/8th inch
chain and says that it wears as well as the narrow chains.

I'd be amazed if someone could come up with a chainguard which fitted round
the chainring, and back towards the rear cog when the distance between the 2
points reduces by around 150mm and the orientation rotates 180 degrees with a
pivot not concentric with the crank axle as the bike is folded. With a larger
diameter at the chainring there will also be a compromising of the clearances
between the front forks, the retaining clip, and the rear frame where it
spreads out for the axle.

I guess you'll probably find Brompton Chainguards on shelf next to sky hooks
for hanging things in thin air......
